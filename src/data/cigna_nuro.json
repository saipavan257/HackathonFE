Cigna considers Exondys 51 medically necessary for patients less than 14 years of age at the start of therapy with a documented diagnosis of DMD confirmed by a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping, and who are able to walk a distance of at least 180 meters independently over 6 minutes. The medication must be prescribed by, or in consultation with, a neurologist, neuromuscular specialist, or by a Muscular Dystrophy Association clinic. For patients currently receiving Exondys 51, approval is based on meeting the initial criteria, experiencing a beneficial clinical response including the continued ability to walk, and continued prescription by or in consultation with a specialist. The dosage is 30 milligrams per kilogram administered once weekly as a 35 to 60-minute intravenous infusion. Concurrent use with other exon-skipping DMD agents is considered experimental, investigational, or unproven. The HCPCS code for Exondys 51 is J1428 (Injection, eteplirsen, 10 mg). Diagnosis and CPT codes are not available in the document. The policy was updated on 8/15/2024 to include the dosing and update the policy title from Eteplirsen. The policy effective date is in force until updated or retired.",
