    "document_summary": "Beyfortus (nirsevimab) is a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein-directed fusion inhibitor used for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease. Anthem covers Beyfortus for neonates and infants born during or entering their first RSV season, and for pediatric individuals up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.\n\nTo be eligible for Beyfortus, the individual must be using it for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease. For individuals less than 8 months of age, they must not have previously received a dose of Beyfortus. For individuals 8-19 months entering their second RSV season, specific criteria must be met, including documentation of preterm birth requiring extended oxygen, cystic fibrosis with severe lung disease, profound immunocompromise, or being American Indian or Alaska Native.\n\nExclusion criteria include using Beyfortus for the treatment of RSV disease, having received five or more doses of Synagis during the same RSV season, or not meeting the above criteria.\n\nQuantity limits are set based on the RSV season and weight of the individual. For the first RSV season, one 50 mg syringe is allowed for infants less than 5 kg, and one 100 mg syringe for infants 5 kg or greater. For the second RSV season, two 100 mg syringes are allowed per 6 months. An additional dose may be approved for individuals undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, with specific quantities based on the timing of the surgery relative to the Beyfortus administration.\n\nHCPCS codes for Beyfortus administration include 90380 and 90381. Diagnosis codes include Z23 (Encounter for immunization) and Z29.11 (Encounter for prophylactic immunotherapy for RSV).\n\nApproval duration is limited to shortly before or during RSV season, typically from October through March, based on CDC surveillance data. The document was last revised on 8/16/2024 to remove criteria related to maternal RSV vaccination and update wording and formatting.",

It is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD), moderate to severe asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), Prurigo Nodularis (PN), and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). \n\nFor asthma, initial approval requires the patient to be 6 years or older with moderate-to-severe asthma, a pretreatment FEV1 ≤ 80% predicted, and FEV1 reversibility of at least 12% and 200 ml after albuterol administration. Additionally, the patient must have a blood eosinophil count ≥ 150 cells/microliter or have had a 3-month trial and inadequate response/intolerance to combination controller therapy. Patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma must have a 3-month trial and inadequate response/intolerance to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid with daily oral glucocorticoids. Patients must have experienced two or more asthma exacerbations in the prior 12 months requiring systemic corticosteroids.\n\nFor COPD, initial approval requires the patient to be 18 years or older with an eosinophilic phenotype, a blood eosinophil count of at least 300 per microliter, and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7. Patients must have moderate to severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 30-70% predicted) and meet one of the following: at least one hospitalization related to COPD in the past 12 months or at least two moderate COPD exacerbations requiring systemic steroids in the past 12 months. Patients must be on a stable dose of LAMA-LABA therapy, including inhaled glucocorticoids, or be unable to use an inhaled glucocorticoid due to a medical reason and be on a stable dose of LAMA-LABA therapy.\n\nFor atopic dermatitis, initial approval requires the patient to be 6 months or older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The patient must have tried and failed to achieve remission with topical calcineurin inhibitors, Eucrisa, Opzelura, Zoryve 0.15% Cream, Vtama Cream, phototherapy, or non-corticosteroid systemic immunosuppressants. Alternatively, the patient must have contraindications to these treatments and be unable to use phototherapy.\n\nFor chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), initial approval requires the patient to be 12 years or older with a diagnosis of CRSwNP demonstrated on anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or CT. The patient must have had a recent trial and inadequate response to maintenance intranasal corticosteroids and a trial and inadequate response/intolerance to systemic corticosteroids or sino-nasal surgery. The patient must be requesting Dupixent as add-on therapy to maintenance intranasal corticosteroids.\n\nFor eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), initial approval requires the patient to be 1 year or older and weigh at least 15kg with a diagnosis of EoE. The patient must have 15 or more intraepithelial eosinophils per high-power field and symptoms of dysphagia. The patient must have tried a course of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and glucocorticoids.\n\nFor Prurigo Nodularis (PN), initial approval requires the patient to be 18 years or older with a diagnosis of PN and 20 or more PN lesions. The patient must have tried and failed to achieve remission with medium to super-potent topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors.\n\nFor chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), initial approval requires the patient to be 12 years of age or older with a diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The patient must have had an inadequate response to a two-week trial of a second generation H1 antihistamine up dosed to a maximum of four times the approved dose.\n\nDupixent is not approved in combination with oral or topical JAK inhibitors, other immunosuppressants, ensifentrine, tralokinumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, lebrikizumab-ibkz, nemolizumab-ilto, mepolizumab, tezepelumab, or omalizumab. It is also not approved for asthma if the patient has current blood eosinophils greater than 1500 cells/microliter and asthma-related causes have not been excluded.\n\nQuantity limits for Dupixent include:\n*   Dupixent (dupilumab) 100mg/0.67 mL syringe: 2 syringes per 28 days.\n*   Dupixent (dupilumab) 200 mg/1.14 mL pre-filled syringe/pen: 1 syringe/pen every 28 days for patients 11 years old or younger, 2 syringes/pens every 28 days for patients 12 years old or older. For individuals weighing 30kg or more, may approve 2 syringes/pens per 28 days. In the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis: May approve 2 syringes/pens per 28 days.\n*   Dupixent (dupilumab) 300 mg/2 mL pre-filled syringe, 300 mg/2 mL pre-filled pen: 1 syringe/pen per 28 days for patients 11 years old or younger, 2 syringes/pens per 28 days for patients 12 years old or older.

    "document_summary": "Dupixent (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 (IL-4)/interleukin 13 (IL-13) inhibitor. It is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD), moderate to severe asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), Prurigo Nodularis (PN), and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). \n\nFor asthma, initial approval requires the patient to be 6 years or older with moderate-to-severe asthma, a pretreatment FEV1 ≤ 80% predicted, and FEV1 reversibility of at least 12% and 200 ml after albuterol administration. Additionally, the patient must have a blood eosinophil count ≥ 150 cells/microliter or have had a 3-month trial and inadequate response/intolerance to combination controller therapy. Patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma must have a 3-month trial and inadequate response/intolerance to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid with daily oral glucocorticoids. Patients must have experienced two or more asthma exacerbations in the prior 12 months requiring systemic corticosteroids.\n\nFor COPD, initial approval requires the patient to be 18 years or older with an eosinophilic phenotype, a blood eosinophil count of at least 300 per microliter, and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7. Patients must have moderate to severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 30-70% predicted) and meet one of the following: at least one hospitalization related to COPD in the past 12 months or at least two moderate COPD exacerbations requiring systemic steroids in the past 12 months. Patients must be on a stable dose of LAMA-LABA therapy, including inhaled glucocorticoids, or be unable to use an inhaled glucocorticoid due to a medical reason and be on a stable dose of LAMA-LABA therapy.\n\nFor atopic dermatitis, initial approval requires the patient to be 6 months or older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The patient must have tried and failed to achieve remission with topical calcineurin inhibitors, Eucrisa, Opzelura, Zoryve 0.15% Cream, Vtama Cream, phototherapy, or non-corticosteroid systemic immunosuppressants. Alternatively, the patient must have contraindications to these treatments and be unable to use phototherapy.\n\nFor chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), initial approval requires the patient to be 12 years or older with a diagnosis of CRSwNP demonstrated on anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or CT. The patient must have had a recent trial and inadequate response to maintenance intranasal corticosteroids and a trial and inadequate response/intolerance to systemic corticosteroids or sino-nasal surgery. The patient must be requesting Dupixent as add-on therapy to maintenance intranasal corticosteroids.\n\nFor eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), initial approval requires the patient to be 1 year or older and weigh at least 15kg with a diagnosis of EoE. The patient must have 15 or more intraepithelial eosinophils per high-power field and symptoms of dysphagia. The patient must have tried a course of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and glucocorticoids.\n\nFor Prurigo Nodularis (PN), initial approval requires the patient to be 18 years or older with a diagnosis of PN and 20 or more PN lesions. The patient must have tried and failed to achieve remission with medium to super-potent topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors.\n\nFor chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), initial approval requires the patient to be 12 years of age or older with a diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The patient must have had an inadequate response to a two-week trial of a second generation H1 antihistamine up dosed to a maximum of four times the approved dose.\n\nDupixent is not approved in combination with oral or topical JAK inhibitors, other immunosuppressants, ensifentrine, tralokinumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, lebrikizumab-ibkz, nemolizumab-ilto, mepolizumab, tezepelumab, or omalizumab. It is also not approved for asthma if the patient has current blood eosinophils greater than 1500 cells/microliter and asthma-related causes have not been excluded.\n\nQuantity limits for Dupixent include:\n*   Dupixent (dupilumab) 100mg/0.67 mL syringe: 2 syringes per 28 days.\n*   Dupixent (dupilumab) 200 mg/1.14 mL pre-filled syringe/pen: 1 syringe/pen every 28 days for patients 11 years old or younger, 2 syringes/pens every 28 days for patients 12 years old or older. For individuals weighing 30kg or more, may approve 2 syringes/pens per 28 days. In the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis: May approve 2 syringes/pens per 28 days.\n*   Dupixent (dupilumab) 300 mg/2 mL pre-filled syringe, 300 mg/2 mL pre-filled pen: 1 syringe/pen per 28 days for patients 11 years old or younger, 2 syringes/pens per 28 days for patients 12 years old or older. For individuals more than 30 kg, may approve 2 syringes/pens per 28 days. In the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis: May approve 4 syringes/pens per 28 days. In the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis for individuals weighing 40 kg or more: May approve 4 syringes/pens per 28 days.\n\nInitiation of therapy may allow for two additional 200 mg/1.14 mL prefilled syringes OR 300 mg/2 mL pre-filled syringes in the first month for atopic dermatitis (6 years or older), asthma (12 years or older), prurigo nodularis, or chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nHCPCS codes for Dupixent include J3590 and C9399. Diagnosis codes include L20.0-L20.9 (Atopic dermatitis), L28.1 (Prurigo nodularis), L50.1 (Idiopathic urticaria), L50.8 (Other urticaria), L50.9 (Urticaria, unspecified), J44.0-J44.9 (Other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), J45.40-J45.52 (Moderate/severe persistent asthma), J45.901-J45.998 (Other and unspecified asthma), J82.83 (Eosinophilic asthma), J32.0-J32.9 (Chronic sinusitis), J33.0-J33.9 (Nasal Polyp), and K20.0 (Eosinophilic esophagitis).\n\nThe document was revised on 2025-06-09 to update chronic obstructive pulmonary disease criteria.

The patient must have tried and failed to achieve remission with topical calcineurin inhibitors, Eucrisa, Opzelura, Zoryve 0.15% Cream, Vtama Cream, phototherapy, or non-corticosteroid systemic immunosuppressants. Alternatively, the patient must have contraindications to these treatments and be unable to use phototherapy.\n\nFor chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), initial approval requires the patient to be 12 years or older with a diagnosis of CRSwNP demonstrated on anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or CT. The patient must have had a recent trial and inadequate response to maintenance intranasal corticosteroids and a trial and inadequate response/intolerance to systemic corticosteroids or sino-nasal surgery. The patient must be requesting Dupixent as add-on therapy to maintenance intranasal corticosteroids.\n\nFor eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), initial approval requires the patient to be 1 year or older and weigh at least 15kg with a diagnosis of EoE. The patient must have 15 or more intraepithelial eosinophils per high-power field and symptoms of dysphagia. The patient must have tried a course of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and glucocorticoids.\n\nFor Prurigo Nodularis (PN), initial approval requires the patient to be 18 years or older with a diagnosis of PN and 20 or more PN lesions.

It is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD), moderate to severe asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), Prurigo Nodularis (PN), and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). \n\nFor asthma, initial approval requires the patient to be 6 years or older with moderate-to-severe asthma, a pretreatment FEV1 ≤ 80% predicted, and FEV1 reversibility of at least 12% and 200 ml after albuterol administration. Additionally, the patient must have a blood eosinophil count ≥ 150 cells/microliter or have had a 3-month trial and inadequate response/intolerance to combination controller therapy. Patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma must have a 3-month trial and inadequate response/intolerance to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid with daily oral glucocorticoids. Patients must have experienced two or more asthma exacerbations in the prior 12 months requiring systemic corticosteroids.\n\nFor COPD, initial approval requires the patient to be 18 years or older with an eosinophilic phenotype, a blood eosinophil count of at least 300 per microliter, and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7. Patients must have moderate to severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 30-70% predicted) and meet one of the following: at least one hospitalization related to COPD in the past 12 months or at least two moderate COPD exacerbations requiring systemic steroids in the past 12 months.

The patient must have tried and failed to achieve remission with topical calcineurin inhibitors, Eucrisa, Opzelura, Zoryve 0.15% Cream, Vtama Cream, phototherapy, or non-corticosteroid systemic immunosuppressants. Alternatively, the patient must have contraindications to these treatments and be unable to use phototherapy.\n\nFor chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), initial approval requires the patient to be 12 years or older with a diagnosis of CRSwNP demonstrated on anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or CT. The patient must have had a recent trial and inadequate response to maintenance intranasal corticosteroids and a trial and inadequate response/intolerance to systemic corticosteroids or sino-nasal surgery. The patient must be requesting Dupixent as add-on therapy to maintenance intranasal corticosteroids.\n\nFor eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), initial approval requires the patient to be 1 year or older and weigh at least 15kg with a diagnosis of EoE. The patient must have 15 or more intraepithelial eosinophils per high-power field and symptoms of dysphagia. The patient must have tried a course of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and glucocorticoids.\n\nFor Prurigo Nodularis (PN), initial approval requires the patient to be 18 years or older with a diagnosis of PN and 20 or more PN lesions. The patient must have tried and failed to achieve remission with medium to super-potent topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors.\n\nFor chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), initial approval requires the patient to be 12 years of age or older with a diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).

    "document_summary": "Dupixent (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 (IL-4)/interleukin 13 (IL-13) inhibitor. It is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD), moderate to severe asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), Prurigo Nodularis (PN), and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). \n\nFor asthma, initial approval requires the patient to be 6 years or older with moderate-to-severe asthma, a pretreatment FEV1 ≤ 80% predicted, and FEV1 reversibility of at least 12% and 200 ml after albuterol administration. Additionally, the patient must have a blood eosinophil count ≥ 150 cells/microliter or have had a 3-month trial and inadequate response/intolerance to combination controller therapy. Patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma must have a 3-month trial and inadequate response/intolerance to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid with daily oral glucocorticoids. Patients must have experienced two or more asthma exacerbations in the prior 12 months requiring systemic corticosteroids.\n\nFor COPD, initial approval requires the patient to be 18 years or older with an eosinophilic phenotype, a blood eosinophil count of at least 300 per microliter, and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.7. Patients must have moderate to severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 30-70% predicted) and meet one of the following: at least one hospitalization related to COPD in the past 12 months or at least two moderate COPD exacerbations requiring systemic steroids in the past 12 months. Patients must be on a stable dose of LAMA-LABA therapy, including inhaled glucocorticoids, or be unable to use an inhaled glucocorticoid due to a medical reason and be on a stable dose of LAMA-LABA therapy.\n\nFor atopic dermatitis, initial approval requires the patient to be 6 months or older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The patient must have tried and failed to achieve remission with topical calcineurin inhibitors, Eucrisa, Opzelura, Zoryve 0.15% Cream, Vtama Cream, phototherapy, or non-corticosteroid systemic immunosuppressants. Alternatively, the patient must have contraindications to these treatments and be unable to use phototherapy.\n\nFor chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), initial approval requires the patient to be 12 years or older with a diagnosis of CRSwNP demonstrated on anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or CT. The patient must have had a recent trial and inadequate response to maintenance intranasal corticosteroids and a trial and inadequate response/intolerance to systemic corticosteroids or sino-nasal surgery. The patient must be requesting Dupixent as add-on therapy to maintenance intranasal corticosteroids.\n\nFor eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), initial approval requires the patient to be 1 year or older and weigh at least 15kg with a diagnosis of EoE. The patient must have 15 or more intraepithelial eosinophils per high-power field and symptoms of dysphagia. The patient must have tried a course of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and glucocorticoids.\n\nFor Prurigo Nodularis (PN), initial approval requires the patient to be 18 years or older with a diagnosis of PN and 20 or more PN lesions. The patient must have tried and failed to achieve remission with medium to super-potent topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors.\n\nFor chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), initial approval requires the patient to be 12 years of age or older with a diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The patient must have had an inadequate response to a two-week trial of a second generation H1 antihistamine up dosed to a maximum of four times the approved dose.\n\nDupixent is not approved in combination with oral or topical JAK inhibitors, other immunosuppressants, ensifentrine, tralokinumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, lebrikizumab-ibkz, nemolizumab-ilto, mepolizumab, tezepelumab, or omalizumab. It is also not approved for asthma if the patient has current blood eosinophils greater than 1500 cells/microliter and asthma-related causes have not been excluded.\n\nQuantity limits for Dupixent include:\n*   Dupixent (dupilumab) 100mg/0.67 mL syringe: 2 syringes per 28 days.\n*   Dupixent (dupilumab) 200 mg/1.14 mL pre-filled syringe/pen: 1 syringe/pen every 28 days for patients 11 years old or younger, 2 syringes/pens every 28 days for patients 12 years old or older. For individuals weighing 30kg or more, may approve 2 syringes/pens per 28 days. In the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis: May approve 2 syringes/pens per 28 days.\n*   Dupixent (dupilumab) 300 mg/2 mL pre-filled syringe, 300 mg/2 mL pre-filled pen: 1 syringe/pen per 28 days for patients 11 years old or younger, 2 syringes/pens per 28 days for patients 12 years old or older. For individuals more than 30 kg, may approve 2 syringes/pens per 28 days. In the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis: May approve 4 syringes/pens per 28 days. In the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis for individuals weighing 40 kg or more: May approve 4 syringes/pens per 28 days.\n\nInitiation of therapy may allow for two additional 200 mg/1.14 mL prefilled syringes OR 300 mg/2 mL pre-filled syringes in the first month for atopic dermatitis (6 years or older), asthma (12 years or older), prurigo nodularis, or chronic spontaneous urticaria.\n\nHCPCS codes for Dupixent include J3590 and C9399. Diagnosis codes include L20.0-L20.9 (Atopic dermatitis), L28.1 (Prurigo nodularis), L50.1 (Idiopathic urticaria), L50.8 (Other urticaria), L50.9 (Urticaria, unspecified), J44.0-J44.9 (Other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), J45.40-J45.52 (Moderate/severe persistent asthma), J45.901-J45.998 (Other and unspecified asthma), J82.83 (Eosinophilic asthma), J32.0-J32.9 (Chronic sinusitis), J33.0-J33.9 (Nasal Polyp), and K20.0 (Eosinophilic esophagitis).\n\nThe document was revised on 2025-06-09 to update chronic obstructive pulmonary disease criteria.
