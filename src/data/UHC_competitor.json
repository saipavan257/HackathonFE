It is indicated to reduce the frequency of vasoocclusive crises (VOCs) in adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with sickle cell disease. UHC covers Adakveo for patients 16 years of age or older with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, including specific genotypes, who meet certain criteria related to prior vasoocclusive crises, hydroxyurea therapy, and concomitant therapies. The coverage also requires that Adakveo is prescribed by or in consultation with a hematologist or specialist. Initial authorization is for no more than 12 months, with continuation requiring a reduction in sickle cell-related vasoocclusive crises. The SUSTAIN trial demonstrated that patients receiving crizanlizumab had a lower median annual rate of VOC compared to those receiving placebo. Adakveo is not covered for pediatric patients less than 16 years of age with sickle cell disease or for the treatment of myelofibrosis. The policy was updated on June 1, 2025, to revise coverage criteria and add a criterion allowing coverage based on the patient\u2019s genotype regarding hydroxyurea candidacy.",

    "Conclusion":"Amvuttra (vutrisiran) is a transthyretin-directed small interfering RNA indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary\u2122 transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults and for cardiomyopathy of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and urgent heart failure visits.\n\nUHC covers Amvuttra for the treatment of cardiomyopathy of wild-type (wtATTR) or hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis and for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary\u2122 transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults who meet specific criteria. Initial therapy requires a diagnosis of wild-type or hereditary ATTR-mediated amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), documentation of a pathogenic TTR mutation or cardiac\/noncardiac tissue biopsy, NYHA Functional Class I, II, or III heart failure, physician attestation of NT-proBNP levels, and documentation of heart failure history or symptoms. Patients must have experienced worsening on or be intolerant\/contraindicated to Vyndaqel\/Vyndamax and Attruby. They must not be receiving Amvuttra in combination with RNA interference agents or transthyretin stabilizers, be prescribed by\/in consultation with a cardiologist, and be dosed according to FDA guidelines. Initial authorization is for up to 12 months.\n\nContinuation of therapy requires previous Amvuttra treatment, a positive clinical response, continued NYHA Functional Class I, II, or III heart failure, no combination with RNA interference agents or transthyretin stabilizers, prescription by\/consultation with a cardiologist, and dosing per FDA guidelines. Authorization is for up to 12 months.\n\nAmvuttra is also medically necessary for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in patients who meet all of the following criteria: diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and documentation that the patient has a pathogenic TTR mutation (e.g., V30M) and Documentation of one of the following: Patient has a baseline polyneuropathy disability (PND) score \u2264 IIIb, Patient has a baseline familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) Stage 1 or 2, Patient has a baseline neuropathy impairment score (NIS) \u2265 5 and \u2264 130, Patient has a baseline Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score \u2265 60% and Presence of clinical signs and symptoms of the disease (e.g., peripheral sensorimotor polyneuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, motor disability, etc.); and Patient has not had a liver transplant; and For Amvuttra, patient is not receiving in combination with any of the following: RNA interference agents [e.g., Onpattro (patisiran), Wainua (eplontersen), Tegsedi (inotersen)] Transthyretin stabilizers [e.g., Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) or Vyndamax (tafamidis)] Prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist; and Dosing is in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration prescribing information; and Initial authorization is for no more than 12 months\n\nContinuation of Therapy Patient has previously received treatment with Amvuttra or Onpattro; and Documentation of one of the following: Patient continues to have a PND score \u2264 IIIb Patient continues to have a FAP stage 1 or 2 Patient continues to have a NIS score \u2265 5 and \u2264 130 Patient continues to have a KPS score \u2265 60% and Documentation that the patient has experienced a positive clinical response to Amvuttra or Onpattro (e.g., improved neurologic impairment, motor function, quality of life, slowing of disease progression, etc.); and For Amvuttra, patient is not receiving in combination with any of the following: RNA interference agents [e.g., Onpattro (patisiran), Wainua (eplontersen), Tegsedi (inotersen)] Transthyretin stabilizers [e.g., Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) or Vyndamax (tafamidis)] Prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist; and Dosing is in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration prescribing information; and Authorization is for no more than 12 months\n\nThe safety and efficacy of vutrisiran in ATTR cardiomyopathy was established in the HELIOS-B trial, demonstrating a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events compared to placebo. The safety and efficacy of vutrisiran was established in a phase 3 randomized, open-label study (NCT03759379) in adult patients with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis. The most common adverse reactions (at least 5%) were arthralgia (11%), dyspnea (7%), and decreased vitamin A (7%).\n\nAmvuttra is not medically necessary for sensorimotor or autonomic neuropathy not related to hATTR amyloidosis or primary\/leptomeningeal amyloidosis.\n\nPolicy updates include template updates, corrected typographical errors, addition of language to indicate Amvuttra (vutrisiran) is proven for the treatment of cardiomyopathy of wild-type (wtATTR) or hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis, and updates to the supporting information.",

    "Conclusion":"Amvuttra (vutrisiran) is a transthyretin-directed small interfering RNA indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary\u2122 transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults and for cardiomyopathy of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and urgent heart failure visits.\n\nUHC covers Amvuttra for the treatment of cardiomyopathy of wild-type (wtATTR) or hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis and for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary\u2122 transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults who meet specific criteria. Initial therapy requires a diagnosis of wild-type or hereditary ATTR-mediated amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), documentation of a pathogenic TTR mutation or cardiac\/noncardiac tissue biopsy, NYHA Functional Class I, II, or III heart failure, physician attestation of NT-proBNP levels, and documentation of heart failure history or symptoms. Patients must have experienced worsening on or be intolerant\/contraindicated to Vyndaqel\/Vyndamax and Attruby. They must not be receiving Amvuttra in combination with RNA interference agents or transthyretin stabilizers, be prescribed by\/in consultation with a cardiologist, and be dosed according to FDA guidelines. Initial authorization is for up to 12 months.\n\nContinuation of therapy requires previous Amvuttra treatment, a positive clinical response, continued NYHA Functional Class I, II, or III heart failure, no combination with RNA interference agents or transthyretin stabilizers, prescription by\/consultation with a cardiologist, and dosing per FDA guidelines. Authorization is for up to 12 months.\n\nAmvuttra is also medically necessary for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in patients who meet all of the following criteria: diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and documentation that the patient has a pathogenic TTR mutation (e.g., V30M) and Documentation of one of the following: Patient has a baseline polyneuropathy disability (PND) score \u2264 IIIb, Patient has a baseline familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) Stage 1 or 2, Patient has a baseline neuropathy impairment score (NIS) \u2265 5 and \u2264 130, Patient has a baseline Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score \u2265 60% and Presence of clinical signs and symptoms of the disease (e.g., peripheral sensorimotor polyneuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, motor disability, etc.); and Patient has not had a liver transplant; and For Amvuttra, patient is not receiving in combination with any of the following: RNA interference agents [e.g., Onpattro (patisiran), Wainua (eplontersen), Tegsedi (inotersen)] Transthyretin stabilizers [e.g., Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) or Vyndamax (tafamidis)] Prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist; and Dosing is in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration prescribing information; and Initial authorization is for no more than 12 months\n\nContinuation of Therapy Patient has previously received treatment with Amvuttra or Onpattro; and Documentation of one of the following: Patient continues to have a PND score \u2264 IIIb Patient continues to have a FAP stage 1 or 2 Patient continues to have a NIS score \u2265 5 and \u2264 130 Patient continues to have a KPS score \u2265 60% and Documentation that the patient has experienced a positive clinical response to Amvuttra or Onpattro (e.g., improved neurologic impairment, motor function, quality of life, slowing of disease progression, etc.); and For Amvuttra, patient is not receiving in combination with any of the following: RNA interference agents [e.g., Onpattro (patisiran), Wainua (eplontersen), Tegsedi (inotersen)] Transthyretin stabilizers [e.g., Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) or Vyndamax (tafamidis)] Prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist; and Dosing is in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration prescribing information; and Authorization is for no more than 12 months\n\nThe safety and efficacy of vutrisiran in ATTR cardiomyopathy was established in the HELIOS-B trial, demonstrating a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events compared to placebo. The safety and efficacy of vutrisiran was established in a phase 3 randomized, open-label study (NCT03759379) in adult patients with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis. The most common adverse reactions (at least 5%) were arthralgia (11%), dyspnea (7%), and decreased vitamin A (7%).\n\nAmvuttra is not medically necessary for sensorimotor or autonomic neuropathy not related to hATTR amyloidosis or primary\/leptomeningeal amyloidosis.\n\nPolicy updates include template updates, corrected typographical errors, addition of language to indicate Amvuttra (vutrisiran) is proven for the treatment of cardiomyopathy of wild-type (wtATTR) or hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis, and updates to the supporting information.",

    "clinical_criteria":"Elrexfio (elranatamab-bcmm) is a bispecific B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed CD3 T-cell engager that redirects T cells to recognize and kill BCMA-expressing myeloma cells.\nIt is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received \u22654 prior lines of therapy, including:\n-A proteasome inhibitor (PI),\n-An immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), and\n-An anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.\nThis reflects a population with advanced, treatment-resistant disease and poor prognosis. Clinical studies (e.g., MagnetisMM-3) demonstrated meaningful overall response rates and durable remissions in heavily pretreated RRMM patients, establishing Elrexfio as a critical therapeutic option where few alternatives remain.",
