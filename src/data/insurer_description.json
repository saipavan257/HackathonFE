Its extensive global reach spans over 170 million customer relationships.\n\nCigna efficiently manages medical-benefit drugs using Coverage Policies (MCPs), enforced via prior authorization, medical necessity assessments, and site-of-care protocols. This strategic framework, combined with its integration with Express Scripts (via Evernorth), strengthens its proficiency in both pharmacy and medical benefit drug management. Even though Cigna isn't the largest insurer, its PBM integration gives it a notable edge in drug management operations."

			"companyDescription": "Humana is a leading Medicare Advantage insurer with ~5.8M MA members (~16.6% market share) as of Q2 2025. It manages medical benefit drugs via transparent Medical Coverage Policies and extensive utilization controls. While primarily serving seniors through MA and PDP products—and growing its CenterWell network—it has reduced its commercial and Medicaid operations. Despite recent financial boost and improved outlook, it faces quality rating challenges that may affect future reimbursements."
