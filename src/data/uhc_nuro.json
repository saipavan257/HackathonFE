    "summary": "Adakveo (crizanlizumab-tmca) is a humanized IgG2 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to P-selectin and blocks interactions with its ligands, including P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1). It is indicated to reduce the frequency of vasoocclusive crises (VOCs) in adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with sickle cell disease. UHC covers Adakveo for patients 16 years of age or older with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, including specific genotypes, who meet certain criteria related to prior vasoocclusive crises, hydroxyurea therapy, and concomitant therapies. The coverage also requires that Adakveo is prescribed by or in consultation with a hematologist or specialist. Initial authorization is for no more than 12 months, with continuation requiring a reduction in sickle cell-related vasoocclusive crises. The SUSTAIN trial demonstrated that patients receiving crizanlizumab had a lower median annual rate of VOC compared to those receiving placebo. Adakveo is not covered for pediatric patients less than 16 years of age with sickle cell disease or for the treatment of myelofibrosis. The policy was updated on June 1, 2025, to revise coverage criteria and add a criterion allowing coverage based on the patient’s genotype regarding hydroxyurea candidacy.",

The efficacy of ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn in the prophylactic treatment of patients with cTTP was evaluated in Study 1, in 46 patients who were randomized to receive 6 months of treatment with either 40 IU/kg of ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn or plasma-based therapies (Period 1), then crossed over to the other treatment for 6 months (Period 2). Thirty-five patients have entered the 6-month single arm period with ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn (Period 3). No patients receiving ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn had an acute TTP event throughout the study, including Period 3 (with a median duration of exposure to ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn of 14 months for patients 12 to < 18 years of age and patients ≥ 18 years of age; and 4 and 1 months in patients 6 to < 12 and < 6 years of age, respectively). One acute TTP event occurred in a patient receiving plasma-based therapies (FFP) prophylactically during Period 1.\nNo subacute TTP events were reported in patients receiving ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn during Periods 1 and 2. In Period 3, two patients receiving ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn prophylaxis had two subacute events of which one was treated with four supplemental doses, 2 of FFP and 2 of ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn. Four patients receiving plasma based therapies had five subacute TTP events in Periods 1 and 2. A total of seven supplemental doses, 2 of FVIII-VWF concentrate, 1 of FFP and 4 of ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn were given to three of these patients.\nThe efficacy of the on-demand (OD) enzyme replacement therapy was evaluated based on the proportion of acute TTP events responding to ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn in both the Prophylactic and the OD cohorts throughout the duration of the study. An acute TTP event responding to ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn was defined as a resolved TTP event when platelet count was ≥ 150,000/ L or platelet count was within 25% of baseline, whichever occurs first, and LDH ≤ 1.5 x baseline or ≤ 1.5 x ULN, without requiring the use of another ADAMTS13-containing agent. Five adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) enrolled in the OD cohort and had a total of six acute TTP events. Of these five patients, two patients were randomized to receive on-demand treatment with ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn and three patients were randomized to receive plasma-based therapies. All 6 acute TTP events resolved after treatment with either ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn or plasma-based therapies.",

It increased from 0.93% normal at baseline to 1.74% normal at week 48 among patients treated with IV casimersen 30 mg/kg once weekly (mean change from baseline, 0.81; p < 0.001) compared with a change from 0.54% normal to 0.76% normal among placebo recipients (mean change from baseline, 0.22; p = 0.09). The mean change from baseline shows a between-group difference of 0.59 (p = 0.004). All casimersen recipients displayed an increase in exon 45 skipping (100% response rate).

    "summary": "Amondys 45 (casimersen) is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients who have mutations in the exon 45 region of the dystrophin gene. UHC covers Amondys 45 for patients with a diagnosis of DMD confirmed by a neurologist, with documentation of a DMD gene mutation amenable to exon 45 skipping. Patients must meet ambulation criteria, either a 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) ≥ 300 meters or be ambulatory without assistive devices and meet NSAA or TTR score requirements. The policy stipulates that Amondys 45 should not be used concomitantly with other exon skipping therapies for DMD. Initial authorization is for 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of maintained ambulation. The ESSENCE trial supports the use of casimersen, demonstrating increased dystrophin levels in treated patients. Amondys 45 is considered unproven for other forms of muscular dystrophy, such as Becker muscular dystrophy. The policy was updated on July 1, 2025, to include criteria regarding prior gene therapy.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Cardiomyopathy of Wild-Type (wtATTR) or Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated (hATTR) Amyloidosis:\nThe safety and efficacy of vutrisiran in ATTR cardiomyopathy was established in a phase 3 randomized, double-blind study (HELIOS-B) (NCT04153149) in adult patients with ATTR-CM set up in a 1:1 ratio to receive vutrisiran (25 mg) or placebo every 12 weeks for up to 36 months. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause and recurrent cardiovascular events. A total of 655 patients underwent randomization; 326 were assigned to receive vutrisiran and 329 to receive placebo. The studies primary end point was met, as vutrisiran demonstrated a lower risk of death from any cause and recurrent cardiovascular events compared to placebo (hazard ratio in the overall population, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.93; p = 0.01; hazard ratio in the monotherapy population, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.93; p = 0.02). A secondary endpoint, lower risk of death from any cause through 42 months, also showed statistical significance (hazard ratio in the overall population, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90; p = 0.01) in favor of vutrisiran. Other secondary endpoints included were the change from baseline at 30 months in functional capacity, as assessed with the 6-minute walk test. In the overall population, the least-squares mean change from baseline in the distance covered on the 6-minute walk test was −45.4 m in the vutrisiran group and −71.9 m in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, 26.5 m; 95% CI, 13.4 to 39.6; p < 0.001). Additionally, patient-reported health status and health-related quality of life, as assessed with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire–Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) was also used as a secondary end point. The least-squares mean change from baseline in the KCCQ-OS score was −9.7 points in the vutrisiran group and −15.5 points in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, 5.8 points; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.2; p < 0.001). At 30 months, in the overall population, 68% of the patients in the vutrisiran group and 61% in the placebo group had improvement or no change in NYHA class (least-squares mean difference, 8.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.3 to 16.1; p = 0.02), another secondary endpoint used for analysis.\n\nPolyneuropathy of Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated (hATTR) Amyloidosis:\nThe safety and efficacy of vutrisiran was established in a phase 3 randomized, open-label study (NCT03759379) in adult patients with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis. Patients eligible for the study met the following criteria: aged 18-25 years, diagnosis of ATTRv amyloidosis with a documented TTR variant and baseline NIS 5-130, polyneuropathy disability (PND) score ≤ IIIb, a KPS ≥ 60, and adequate liver and renal function. Patients were randomized 3:1 to receive 25 mg of vutrisiran subcutaneously once every 3 months (n = 122), or 0.3mg/kg patisiran intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 42) as a reference group. Efficacy assessments were based on a comparison of the vutrisiran with an external placebo group in another study (NCT01960348) composed of a comparable population of adult patients with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to month 9 in modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 (mNIS + 7). The mNIS + 7 has a total score range from 0 to 304 points, with higher scores representing a greater severity of disease. The least squares mean change from baseline for the mNIS + 7 score was -2.2 for vutrisiran vs. + 14.8 for placebo (difference of -17.0, 95% CI: -21.8, -12.2; p < 0.001). The clinical meaningfulness of effects on the mNIS + 7 was assessed by the change from baseline to Month 9 in Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (QoL-DN) total score. The Norfolk QoL-DN scale is a patient-reported assessment that evaluates the subjective experience of neuropathy in the following domains: physical functioning/large fiber neuropathy, activities of daily living, symptoms, small fiber neuropathy, and autonomic neuropathy. The Norfolk QoL-DN has a total score range from -4 to 136, with higher scores representing greater impairment. Additional endpoints were gait speed, as measured by the 10-meter walk test (10MWT), and modified body mass index (mBMI). The mean least squares mean change from baseline for the Norfolk QoL-DN total score was -3.3 for vutrisiran vs. + 12.9 for placebo (difference of -16.2, 95% CI: -21.7, -10.8; p < 0.001. The mean least squares mean change from baseline for the 10-meter walk test was 0 for vutrisiran vs. -0.13 for placebo (difference of 0.13, 95% CI; 0.07, 0.19; p < 0.001) and 10-meter walk test at Month 9 compared to placebo in the external study (p < 0.001).

    "summary": "Amvuttra (vutrisiran) is a transthyretin-directed small interfering RNA indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary™ transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults and for cardiomyopathy of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and urgent heart failure visits.\n\nUHC covers Amvuttra for the treatment of cardiomyopathy of wild-type (wtATTR) or hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis and for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary™ transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults who meet specific criteria. Initial therapy requires a diagnosis of wild-type or hereditary ATTR-mediated amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), documentation of a pathogenic TTR mutation or cardiac/noncardiac tissue biopsy, NYHA Functional Class I, II, or III heart failure, physician attestation of NT-proBNP levels, and documentation of heart failure history or symptoms. Patients must have experienced worsening on or be intolerant/contraindicated to Vyndaqel/Vyndamax and Attruby. They must not be receiving Amvuttra in combination with RNA interference agents or transthyretin stabilizers, be prescribed by/in consultation with a cardiologist, and be dosed according to FDA guidelines. Initial authorization is for up to 12 months.\n\nContinuation of therapy requires previous Amvuttra treatment, a positive clinical response, continued NYHA Functional Class I, II, or III heart failure, no combination with RNA interference agents or transthyretin stabilizers, prescription by/consultation with a cardiologist, and dosing per FDA guidelines. Authorization is for up to 12 months.\n\nAmvuttra is also medically necessary for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in patients who meet all of the following criteria: diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and documentation that the patient has a pathogenic TTR mutation (e.g., V30M) and Documentation of one of the following: Patient has a baseline polyneuropathy disability (PND) score ≤ IIIb, Patient has a baseline familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) Stage 1 or 2, Patient has a baseline neuropathy impairment score (NIS) ≥ 5 and ≤ 130, Patient has a baseline Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score ≥ 60% and Presence of clinical signs and symptoms of the disease (e.g., peripheral sensorimotor polyneuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, motor disability, etc.); and Patient has not had a liver transplant; and For Amvuttra, patient is not receiving in combination with any of the following: RNA interference agents [e.g., Onpattro (patisiran), Wainua (eplontersen), Tegsedi (inotersen)] Transthyretin stabilizers [e.g., Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) or Vyndamax (tafamidis)] Prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist; and Dosing is in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration prescribing information; and Initial authorization is for no more than 12 months\n\nContinuation of Therapy Patient has previously received treatment with Amvuttra or Onpattro; and Documentation of one of the following: Patient continues to have a PND score ≤ IIIb Patient continues to have a FAP stage 1 or 2 Patient continues to have a NIS score ≥ 5 and ≤ 130 Patient continues to have a KPS score ≥ 60% and Documentation that the patient has experienced a positive clinical response to Amvuttra or Onpattro (e.g., improved neurologic impairment, motor function, quality of life, slowing of disease progression, etc.); and For Amvuttra, patient is not receiving in combination with any of the following: RNA interference agents [e.g., Onpattro (patisiran), Wainua (eplontersen), Tegsedi (inotersen)] Transthyretin stabilizers [e.g., Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) or Vyndamax (tafamidis)] Prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist; and Dosing is in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration prescribing information; and Authorization is for no more than 12 months\n\nThe safety and efficacy of vutrisiran in ATTR cardiomyopathy was established in the HELIOS-B trial, demonstrating a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events compared to placebo. The safety and efficacy of vutrisiran was established in a phase 3 randomized, open-label study (NCT03759379) in adult patients with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis. The most common adverse reactions (at least 5%) were arthralgia (11%), dyspnea (7%), and decreased vitamin A (7%).\n\nAmvuttra is not medically necessary for sensorimotor or autonomic neuropathy not related to hATTR amyloidosis or primary/leptomeningeal amyloidosis.\n\nPolicy updates include template updates, corrected typographical errors, addition of language to indicate Amvuttra (vutrisiran) is proven for the treatment of cardiomyopathy of wild-type (wtATTR) or hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis, and updates to the supporting information.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Cardiomyopathy of Wild-Type (wtATTR) or Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated (hATTR) Amyloidosis:\nThe safety and efficacy of vutrisiran in ATTR cardiomyopathy was established in a phase 3 randomized, double-blind study (HELIOS-B) (NCT04153149) in adult patients with ATTR-CM set up in a 1:1 ratio to receive vutrisiran (25 mg) or placebo every 12 weeks for up to 36 months. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause and recurrent cardiovascular events. A total of 655 patients underwent randomization; 326 were assigned to receive vutrisiran and 329 to receive placebo. The studies primary end point was met, as vutrisiran demonstrated a lower risk of death from any cause and recurrent cardiovascular events compared to placebo (hazard ratio in the overall population, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.93; p = 0.01; hazard ratio in the monotherapy population, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.93; p = 0.02). A secondary endpoint, lower risk of death from any cause through 42 months, also showed statistical significance (hazard ratio in the overall population, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90; p = 0.01) in favor of vutrisiran. Other secondary endpoints included were the change from baseline at 30 months in functional capacity, as assessed with the 6-minute walk test. In the overall population, the least-squares mean change from baseline in the distance covered on the 6-minute walk test was −45.4 m in the vutrisiran group and −71.9 m in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, 26.5 m; 95% CI, 13.4 to 39.6; p < 0.001). Additionally, patient-reported health status and health-related quality of life, as assessed with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire–Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) was also used as a secondary end point. The least-squares mean change from baseline in the KCCQ-OS score was −9.7 points in the vutrisiran group and −15.5 points in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, 5.8 points; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.2; p < 0.001). At 30 months, in the overall population, 68% of the patients in the vutrisiran group and 61% in the placebo group had improvement or no change in NYHA class (least-squares mean difference, 8.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.3 to 16.1; p = 0.02), another secondary endpoint used for analysis.\n\nPolyneuropathy of Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated (hATTR) Amyloidosis:\nThe safety and efficacy of vutrisiran was established in a phase 3 randomized, open-label study (NCT03759379) in adult patients with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis. Patients eligible for the study met the following criteria: aged 18-25 years, diagnosis of ATTRv amyloidosis with a documented TTR variant and baseline NIS 5-130, polyneuropathy disability (PND) score ≤ IIIb, a KPS ≥ 60, and adequate liver and renal function. Patients were randomized 3:1 to receive 25 mg of vutrisiran subcutaneously once every 3 months (n = 122), or 0.3mg/kg patisiran intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 42) as a reference group. Efficacy assessments were based on a comparison of the vutrisiran with an external placebo group in another study (NCT01960348) composed of a comparable population of adult patients with polyneuropathy caused by hATTR amyloidosis. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to month 9 in modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 (mNIS + 7). The mNIS + 7 has a total score range from 0 to 304 points, with higher scores representing a greater severity of disease. The least squares mean change from baseline for the mNIS + 7 score was -2.2 for vutrisiran vs. + 14.8 for placebo (difference of -17.0, 95% CI: -21.8, -12.2; p < 0.001). The clinical meaningfulness of effects on the mNIS + 7 was assessed by the change from baseline to Month 9 in Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (QoL-DN) total score. The Norfolk QoL-DN scale is a patient-reported assessment that evaluates the subjective experience of neuropathy in the following domains: physical functioning/large fiber neuropathy, activities of daily living, symptoms, small fiber neuropathy, and autonomic neuropathy. The Norfolk QoL-DN has a total score range from -4 to 136, with higher scores representing greater impairment. Additional endpoints were gait speed, as measured by the 10-meter walk test (10MWT), and modified body mass index (mBMI). The mean least squares mean change from baseline for the Norfolk QoL-DN total score was -3.3 for vutrisiran vs. + 12.9 for placebo (difference of -16.2, 95% CI: -21.7, -10.8; p < 0.001. The mean least squares mean change from baseline for the 10-meter walk test was 0 for vutrisiran vs. -0.13 for placebo (difference of 0.13, 95% CI; 0.07, 0.19; p < 0.001) and 10-meter walk test at Month 9 compared to placebo in the external study (p < 0.001).

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus:\nGinzler et al evaluated the efficacy/safety of belimumab plus standard therapy in patients (n = 449) with active SLE treated up to 7 years (n = 177, currently ongoing).14 Patients (n = 345) who completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study of belimumab 1, 4, or 10 mg/kg and 24-week extension of belimumab (placebo switched to 10 mg/kg; belimumab same dose or switched to 10 mg/kg) could receive belimumab 10 mg/kg in an open-label continuation study (n = 296). Disease activity was analyzed in patients with active SLE at baseline of the initial study. Efficacy endpoints measured included percentage change in the Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI), frequency of 1 new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A or 2 new B scores, frequencies of mild-moderate and severe flares as defined by SELENA-SLEDAI Flair Index (SFI), and change in corticosteroid use. Total belimumab exposure over 7 years (double-blind5 and open-label periods14) was 1746 patient-years. SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rates reported at Week 52 in autoantibody-positive patients was placebo, 29%; belimumab, 46% (p < 0.05). Researchers reported the following in the continuation study: 57% of auto-antibody-positive patients had an SRI response by Year 2 and 65% by Year 7; severe flares occurred in 19% with placebo and 17% with belimumab during the first year, with the annual rate declining to 2%-9% during years 2-7. Anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in patients positive for them at baseline had a progressive decline of 40%-60% from baseline over 2-7 years with belimumab. Corticosteroid use decreased over time with ≥ 50-55% reduction in median dose during years 5-7. Serious and overall annual AE rates, including infections, were generally stable or decreased during 7-year treatment.\n\nIn a post hoc, pooled analysis of the BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 studies, Strand et al assessed the effects of belimumab treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).17 The authors analyzed data from the major secondary endpoints of the two studies, which were the mean change in SF-36v2 Health Survey Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores at week 24. Additional pre-specified secondary endpoints included mean changes from baseline in Short Form-36 (SF-36) PCS, Mental Component Summary (MCS), and domains, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) V.4, and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) scores at weeks 12, 24, 52 and 76 (BLISS-76 only). The SF-36, FACIT-Fatigue, and EQ-5D were administered at baseline, and weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 52 in both trials, and additionally at weeks 20, 32, 40, 48, 68 and 76 in BLISS-76 and week 36 in BLISS-52. Baseline SF-36 scores were 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) below age-/sex-matched US norms with similar improvement at week 24 across treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in PCS scores were significantly (p < 0.05) greater with belimumab 1 mg/kg (4.20) and 10 mg/kg (4.18) versus placebo (2.96) in BLISS-52, week 52. In BLISS-76, significantly (p < 0.05) greater improvements were seen with belimumab 1 mg/kg in PCS (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 4.37, 10 mg/kg = 3.41 vs placebo = 2.85) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 3.14, 10 mg/kg = 2.70 vs placebo = 1.40) at week 52, and in MCS score at week 76 (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 3.05, 10 mg/kg = 2.28 vs placebo = 1.36), however, mean changes in PCS and MCS scores with belimumab 10mg/kg were not significantly different (week 52: PCS = 3.41, MCS = 2.70, and MCS week 76 = 2.28). In pooled analysis, there were significantly greater improvements in PCS scores with both belimumab doses versus placebo (p < 0.05), and MCS scores with 1mg/kg (p < 0.01). FACIT-Fatigue scores were not significantly different at week 24, however at week 52, scores improved significantly (p < 0.05) with belimumab 1 and 10mg/kg vs. placebo in BLISS-52, and with 1mg/kg at weeks 52 and 76 in BLISS-76. In pooled analysis, FACIT-Fatigue scores were significantly improved (p < 0.05) with both dosages at week 52, as well as weeks 8 and 12. EQ-5D utility index and VAS scores were not significantly different between treatment groups in BLISS-52. In BLISS-76, the EQ-5D VAS score was only significantly improved with belimumab 1mg/kg at week 52.\n\nActive Lupus Nephritis:\nThe safety and effectiveness of belimumab 10 mg/kg administered intravenously over 1 hour on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days plus standard therapy were evaluated in a 104-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 448 adult patients with active proliferative and/or membranous lupus nephritis. The patients had a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to American College of Rheumatology classification criteria; biopsy-proven lupus nephritis Class III, IV, and/or V; and had active renal disease at screening requiring standard therapy: corticosteroids with 1) mycophenolate for induction followed by mycophenolate for maintenance, or 2) cyclophosphamide for induction followed by azathioprine for maintenance. This trial was conducted in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe. The mean age of patients was 33 years (range: 18-77); the majority (88%) were female. The primary efficacy endpoint was Primary Efficacy Renal Response (PERR) at Week 104, defined as a response at Week 100 confirmed by a repeat measurement at Week 104 of the following parameters: urine protein: creatinine ratio (uPCR) ≤ 0.7 g/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or no decrease in eGFR of > 20% from pre-flare value. The major secondary endpoints included Complete Renal Response (CRR) defined as a response at Week 100 confirmed by a repeat measurement at Week 104 of the following parameters: uPCR 10% from pre-flare value, PERR at Week 52 and time to renal-related event or death (renal-related event defined as first event of end-stage renal disease, doubling of serum creatinine, renal worsening [defined by quantified increase in proteinuria and/or impaired renal function], or receipt of renal disease-related prohibited therapy due to inadequate lupus nephritis control or renal flare management). The proportion of patients achieving PERR at Week 104 was significantly higher in patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy. The major secondary endpoints also showed significant improvement with belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy. Subjects who received BENLYSTA were significantly less likely to experience a renal-related event or death compared with placebo. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of belimumab 10 mg/kg administered intravenously over 1 hour on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days plus standard therapy was evaluated in an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and safety study conducted in 93 pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. Patients had active SLE disease, defined as a SELENA-SLEDAI score ≥ 6 and positive autoantibodies at screening as defined in the adult trials. Patients were on a stable SLE treatment regimen (standard of care) and had similar inclusion and exclusion criteria as in the adult studies. The median age was 15 years (range: 6 to 17). The majority (95%) of patients were female. More than 50% of patients had 3 or more active organ systems involved at baseline. The most common active organ systems at baseline based on SELENA-SLEDAI were mucocutaneous (91%), immunologic (74%), and musculoskeletal (73%). Overall, 19% of pediatric patients had some degree of renal activity and less than 7% had activity in the cardio-respiratory, hematologic, CNS or vascular systems. Randomization into age-related treatment cohorts was stratified by screening SELENA-SLEDAI scores (6 to 12 vs > 13) and age (5 to 11 years vs 12 to 17 years). The primary efficacy endpoint was the SLE Responder Index (SRI-4) at Week 52, as described in the adult intravenous trials. There was a numerically higher proportion of pediatric patients achieving a response in SRI-4 and its components in pediatric patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy [53% vs. 44%; OR 1.49 (0.64, 3.46)]. A major secondary endpoint, the probability of experiencing a severe SLE flare, as measured by the modified SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index, excluding severe flares triggered only by an increase of the SELENA-SLEDAI score to > 12, was calculated. The proportion of pediatric patients reporting at least one severe flare during the study was numerically lower in pediatric patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy (17%) compared with those receiving placebo plus standard therapy (35%). Pediatric patients receiving belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy had a 64% lower risk of experiencing a severe flare during the 52 weeks of observation, relative to the placebo plus standard therapy group. Of the pediatric patients experiencing a severe flare, the median time to the first severe flare was 150 days in pediatric patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy compared with 113 days in pediatric patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus:\nGinzler et al evaluated the efficacy/safety of belimumab plus standard therapy in patients (n = 449) with active SLE treated up to 7 years (n = 177, currently ongoing).14 Patients (n = 345) who completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study of belimumab 1, 4, or 10 mg/kg and 24-week extension of belimumab (placebo switched to 10 mg/kg; belimumab same dose or switched to 10 mg/kg) could receive belimumab 10 mg/kg in an open-label continuation study (n = 296). Disease activity was analyzed in patients with active SLE at baseline of the initial study. Efficacy endpoints measured included percentage change in the Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI), frequency of 1 new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A or 2 new B scores, frequencies of mild-moderate and severe flares as defined by SELENA-SLEDAI Flair Index (SFI), and change in corticosteroid use. Total belimumab exposure over 7 years (double-blind5 and open-label periods14) was 1746 patient-years. SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rates reported at Week 52 in autoantibody-positive patients was placebo, 29%; belimumab, 46% (p < 0.05). Researchers reported the following in the continuation study: 57% of auto-antibody-positive patients had an SRI response by Year 2 and 65% by Year 7; severe flares occurred in 19% with placebo and 17% with belimumab during the first year, with the annual rate declining to 2%-9% during years 2-7. Anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in patients positive for them at baseline had a progressive decline of 40%-60% from baseline over 2-7 years with belimumab. Corticosteroid use decreased over time with ≥ 50-55% reduction in median dose during years 5-7. Serious and overall annual AE rates, including infections, were generally stable or decreased during 7-year treatment.\n\nIn a post hoc, pooled analysis of the BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 studies, Strand et al assessed the effects of belimumab treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).17 The authors analyzed data from the major secondary endpoints of the two studies, which were the mean change in SF-36v2 Health Survey Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores at week 24. Additional pre-specified secondary endpoints included mean changes from baseline in Short Form-36 (SF-36) PCS, Mental Component Summary (MCS), and domains, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) V.4, and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) scores at weeks 12, 24, 52 and 76 (BLISS-76 only). The SF-36, FACIT-Fatigue, and EQ-5D were administered at baseline, and weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 52 in both trials, and additionally at weeks 20, 32, 40, 48, 68 and 76 in BLISS-76 and week 36 in BLISS-52. Baseline SF-36 scores were 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) below age-/sex-matched US norms with similar improvement at week 24 across treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in PCS scores were significantly (p < 0.05) greater with belimumab 1 mg/kg (4.20) and 10 mg/kg (4.18) versus placebo (2.96) in BLISS-52, week 52. In BLISS-76, significantly (p < 0.05) greater improvements were seen with belimumab 1 mg/kg in PCS (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 4.37, 10 mg/kg = 3.41 vs placebo = 2.85) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 3.14, 10 mg/kg = 2.70 vs placebo = 1.40) at week 52, and in MCS score at week 76 (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 3.05, 10 mg/kg = 2.28 vs placebo = 1.36), however, mean changes in PCS and MCS scores with belimumab 10mg/kg were not significantly different (week 52: PCS = 3.41, MCS = 2.70, and MCS week 76 = 2.28). In pooled analysis, there were significantly greater improvements in PCS scores with both belimumab doses versus placebo (p < 0.05), and MCS scores with 1mg/kg (p < 0.01). FACIT-Fatigue scores were not significantly different at week 24, however at week 52, scores improved significantly (p < 0.05) with belimumab 1 and 10mg/kg vs. placebo in BLISS-52, and with 1mg/kg at weeks 52 and 76 in BLISS-76. In pooled analysis, FACIT-Fatigue scores were significantly improved (p < 0.05) with both dosages at week 52, as well as weeks 8 and 12. EQ-5D utility index and VAS scores were not significantly different between treatment groups in BLISS-52. In BLISS-76, the EQ-5D VAS score was only significantly improved with belimumab 1mg/kg at week 52.\n\nActive Lupus Nephritis:\nThe safety and effectiveness of belimumab 10 mg/kg administered intravenously over 1 hour on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days plus standard therapy were evaluated in a 104-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 448 adult patients with active proliferative and/or membranous lupus nephritis. The patients had a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to American College of Rheumatology classification criteria; biopsy-proven lupus nephritis Class III, IV, and/or V; and had active renal disease at screening requiring standard therapy: corticosteroids with 1) mycophenolate for induction followed by mycophenolate for maintenance, or 2) cyclophosphamide for induction followed by azathioprine for maintenance. This trial was conducted in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe. The mean age of patients was 33 years (range: 18-77); the majority (88%) were female. The primary efficacy endpoint was Primary Efficacy Renal Response (PERR) at Week 104, defined as a response at Week 100 confirmed by a repeat measurement at Week 104 of the following parameters: urine protein: creatinine ratio (uPCR) ≤ 0.7 g/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or no decrease in eGFR of > 20% from pre-flare value. The major secondary endpoints included Complete Renal Response (CRR) defined as a response at Week 100 confirmed by a repeat measurement at Week 104 of the following parameters: uPCR 10% from pre-flare value, PERR at Week 52 and time to renal-related event or death (renal-related event defined as first event of end-stage renal disease, doubling of serum creatinine, renal worsening [defined by quantified increase in proteinuria and/or impaired renal function], or receipt of renal disease-related prohibited therapy due to inadequate lupus nephritis control or renal flare management). The proportion of patients achieving PERR at Week 104 was significantly higher in patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy. The major secondary endpoints also showed significant improvement with belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy. Subjects who received BENLYSTA were significantly less likely to experience a renal-related event or death compared with placebo. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of belimumab 10 mg/kg administered intravenously over 1 hour on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days plus standard therapy was evaluated in an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and safety study conducted in 93 pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. Patients had active SLE disease, defined as a SELENA-SLEDAI score ≥ 6 and positive autoantibodies at screening as defined in the adult trials. Patients were on a stable SLE treatment regimen (standard of care) and had similar inclusion and exclusion criteria as in the adult studies. The median age was 15 years (range: 6 to 17). The majority (95%) of patients were female. More than 50% of patients had 3 or more active organ systems involved at baseline. The most common active organ systems at baseline based on SELENA-SLEDAI were mucocutaneous (91%), immunologic (74%), and musculoskeletal (73%). Overall, 19% of pediatric patients had some degree of renal activity and less than 7% had activity in the cardio-respiratory, hematologic, CNS or vascular systems. Randomization into age-related treatment cohorts was stratified by screening SELENA-SLEDAI scores (6 to 12 vs > 13) and age (5 to 11 years vs 12 to 17 years). The primary efficacy endpoint was the SLE Responder Index (SRI-4) at Week 52, as described in the adult intravenous trials. There was a numerically higher proportion of pediatric patients achieving a response in SRI-4 and its components in pediatric patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy [53% vs. 44%; OR 1.49 (0.64, 3.46)]. A major secondary endpoint, the probability of experiencing a severe SLE flare, as measured by the modified SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index, excluding severe flares triggered only by an increase of the SELENA-SLEDAI score to > 12, was calculated. The proportion of pediatric patients reporting at least one severe flare during the study was numerically lower in pediatric patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy (17%) compared with those receiving placebo plus standard therapy (35%). Pediatric patients receiving belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy had a 64% lower risk of experiencing a severe flare during the 52 weeks of observation, relative to the placebo plus standard therapy group. Of the pediatric patients experiencing a severe flare, the median time to the first severe flare was 150 days in pediatric patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy compared with 113 days in pediatric patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy.",

    "summary": "Benlysta (belimumab) is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLyS). It is indicated for the treatment of active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and active lupus nephritis (LN) in patients aged 5 years and older who are receiving standard therapy. UHC covers Benlysta for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and active lupus nephritis when specific criteria are met, including diagnosis of active SLE or LN without severe active central nervous system lupus, current treatment with at least one standard of care treatment, and not receiving Benlysta in combination with Lupkynis or Saphnelo. Initial and continuation therapy require documentation of positive clinical response and adherence to FDA-labeled dosing. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of belimumab in patients with active SLE and active lupus nephritis. Benlysta is unproven and not medically necessary for conditions such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, severe active central nervous system (CNS) lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, use in combination with other biologics, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia.

In BLISS-76, significantly (p < 0.05) greater improvements were seen with belimumab 1 mg/kg in PCS (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 4.37, 10 mg/kg = 3.41 vs placebo = 2.85) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 3.14, 10 mg/kg = 2.70 vs placebo = 1.40) at week 52, and in MCS score at week 76 (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 3.05, 10 mg/kg = 2.28 vs placebo = 1.36), however, mean changes in PCS and MCS scores with belimumab 10mg/kg were not significantly different (week 52: PCS = 3.41, MCS = 2.70, and MCS week 76 = 2.28). In pooled analysis, there were significantly greater improvements in PCS scores with both belimumab doses versus placebo (p < 0.05), and MCS scores with 1mg/kg (p < 0.01). FACIT-Fatigue scores were not significantly different at week 24, however at week 52, scores improved significantly (p < 0.05) with belimumab 1 and 10mg/kg vs. placebo in BLISS-52, and with 1mg/kg at weeks 52 and 76 in BLISS-76. In pooled analysis, FACIT-Fatigue scores were significantly improved (p < 0.05) with both dosages at week 52, as well as weeks 8 and 12. EQ-5D utility index and VAS scores were not significantly different between treatment groups in BLISS-52. In BLISS-76, the EQ-5D VAS score was only significantly improved with belimumab 1mg/kg at week 52.\n\nActive Lupus Nephritis:\nThe safety and effectiveness of belimumab 10 mg/kg administered intravenously over 1 hour on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days plus standard therapy were evaluated in a 104-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 448 adult patients with active proliferative and/or membranous lupus nephritis. The patients had a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to American College of Rheumatology classification criteria; biopsy-proven lupus nephritis Class III, IV, and/or V; and had active renal disease at screening requiring standard therapy: corticosteroids with 1) mycophenolate for induction followed by mycophenolate for maintenance, or 2) cyclophosphamide for induction followed by azathioprine for maintenance. This trial was conducted in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe. The mean age of patients was 33 years (range: 18-77); the majority (88%) were female. The primary efficacy endpoint was Primary Efficacy Renal Response (PERR) at Week 104, defined as a response at Week 100 confirmed by a repeat measurement at Week 104 of the following parameters: urine protein: creatinine ratio (uPCR) ≤ 0.7 g/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or no decrease in eGFR of > 20% from pre-flare value. The major secondary endpoints included Complete Renal Response (CRR) defined as a response at Week 100 confirmed by a repeat measurement at Week 104 of the following parameters: uPCR 10% from pre-flare value, PERR at Week 52 and time to renal-related event or death (renal-related event defined as first event of end-stage renal disease, doubling of serum creatinine, renal worsening [defined by quantified increase in proteinuria and/or impaired renal function], or receipt of renal disease-related prohibited therapy due to inadequate lupus nephritis control or renal flare management). The proportion of patients achieving PERR at Week 104 was significantly higher in patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy. The major secondary endpoints also showed significant improvement with belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy. Subjects who received BENLYSTA were significantly less likely to experience a renal-related event or death compared with placebo. \n\nThe safety and efficacy of belimumab 10 mg/kg administered intravenously over 1 hour on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days plus standard therapy was evaluated in an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy and safety study conducted in 93 pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. Patients had active SLE disease, defined as a SELENA-SLEDAI score ≥ 6 and positive autoantibodies at screening as defined in the adult trials. Patients were on a stable SLE treatment regimen (standard of care) and had similar inclusion and exclusion criteria as in the adult studies. The median age was 15 years (range: 6 to 17). The majority (95%) of patients were female. More than 50% of patients had 3 or more active organ systems involved at baseline. The most common active organ systems at baseline based on SELENA-SLEDAI were mucocutaneous (91%), immunologic (74%), and musculoskeletal (73%). Overall, 19% of pediatric patients had some degree of renal activity and less than 7% had activity in the cardio-respiratory, hematologic, CNS or vascular systems. Randomization into age-related treatment cohorts was stratified by screening SELENA-SLEDAI scores (6 to 12 vs > 13) and age (5 to 11 years vs 12 to 17 years). The primary efficacy endpoint was the SLE Responder Index (SRI-4) at Week 52, as described in the adult intravenous trials. There was a numerically higher proportion of pediatric patients achieving a response in SRI-4 and its components in pediatric patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy [53% vs. 44%; OR 1.49 (0.64, 3.46)]. A major secondary endpoint, the probability of experiencing a severe SLE flare, as measured by the modified SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index, excluding severe flares triggered only by an increase of the SELENA-SLEDAI score to > 12, was calculated. The proportion of pediatric patients reporting at least one severe flare during the study was numerically lower in pediatric patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy (17%) compared with those receiving placebo plus standard therapy (35%). Pediatric patients receiving belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy had a 64% lower risk of experiencing a severe flare during the 52 weeks of observation, relative to the placebo plus standard therapy group. Of the pediatric patients experiencing a severe flare, the median time to the first severe flare was 150 days in pediatric patients receiving belimumab plus standard therapy compared with 113 days in pediatric patients receiving placebo plus standard therapy.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus:\nGinzler et al evaluated the efficacy/safety of belimumab plus standard therapy in patients (n = 449) with active SLE treated up to 7 years (n = 177, currently ongoing).14 Patients (n = 345) who completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study of belimumab 1, 4, or 10 mg/kg and 24-week extension of belimumab (placebo switched to 10 mg/kg; belimumab same dose or switched to 10 mg/kg) could receive belimumab 10 mg/kg in an open-label continuation study (n = 296). Disease activity was analyzed in patients with active SLE at baseline of the initial study. Efficacy endpoints measured included percentage change in the Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI), frequency of 1 new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A or 2 new B scores, frequencies of mild-moderate and severe flares as defined by SELENA-SLEDAI Flair Index (SFI), and change in corticosteroid use. Total belimumab exposure over 7 years (double-blind5 and open-label periods14) was 1746 patient-years. SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rates reported at Week 52 in autoantibody-positive patients was placebo, 29%; belimumab, 46% (p < 0.05). Researchers reported the following in the continuation study: 57% of auto-antibody-positive patients had an SRI response by Year 2 and 65% by Year 7; severe flares occurred in 19% with placebo and 17% with belimumab during the first year, with the annual rate declining to 2%-9% during years 2-7. Anti-dsDNA autoantibodies in patients positive for them at baseline had a progressive decline of 40%-60% from baseline over 2-7 years with belimumab. Corticosteroid use decreased over time with ≥ 50-55% reduction in median dose during years 5-7. Serious and overall annual AE rates, including infections, were generally stable or decreased during 7-year treatment.\n\nIn a post hoc, pooled analysis of the BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 studies, Strand et al assessed the effects of belimumab treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).17 The authors analyzed data from the major secondary endpoints of the two studies, which were the mean change in SF-36v2 Health Survey Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores at week 24. Additional pre-specified secondary endpoints included mean changes from baseline in Short Form-36 (SF-36) PCS, Mental Component Summary (MCS), and domains, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) V.4, and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) scores at weeks 12, 24, 52 and 76 (BLISS-76 only). The SF-36, FACIT-Fatigue, and EQ-5D were administered at baseline, and weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 52 in both trials, and additionally at weeks 20, 32, 40, 48, 68 and 76 in BLISS-76 and week 36 in BLISS-52. Baseline SF-36 scores were 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) below age-/sex-matched US norms with similar improvement at week 24 across treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in PCS scores were significantly (p < 0.05) greater with belimumab 1 mg/kg (4.20) and 10 mg/kg (4.18) versus placebo (2.96) in BLISS-52, week 52. In BLISS-76, significantly (p < 0.05) greater improvements were seen with belimumab 1 mg/kg in PCS (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 4.37, 10 mg/kg = 3.41 vs placebo = 2.85) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 3.14, 10 mg/kg = 2.70 vs placebo = 1.40) at week 52, and in MCS score at week 76 (belimumab 1 mg/kg = 3.05, 10 mg/kg = 2.28 vs placebo = 1.36), however, mean changes in PCS and MCS scores with belimumab 10mg/kg were not significantly different (week 52: PCS = 3.41, MCS = 2.70, and MCS week 76 = 2.28). In pooled analysis, there were significantly greater improvements in PCS scores with both belimumab doses versus placebo (p < 0.05), and MCS scores with 1mg/kg (p < 0.01). FACIT-Fatigue scores were not significantly different at week 24, however at week 52, scores improved significantly (p < 0.05) with belimumab 1 and 10mg/kg vs. placebo in BLISS-52, and with 1mg/kg at weeks 52 and 76 in BLISS-76. In pooled analysis, FACIT-Fatigue scores were significantly improved (p < 0.05) with both dosages at week 52, as well as weeks 8 and 12. EQ-5D utility index and VAS scores were not significantly different between treatment groups in BLISS-52. In BLISS-76, the EQ-5D VAS score was only significantly improved with belimumab 1mg/kg at week 52.\n\nActive Lupus Nephritis:\nThe safety and effectiveness of belimumab 10 mg/kg administered intravenously over 1 hour on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days plus standard therapy were evaluated in a 104-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 448 adult patients with active proliferative and/or membranous lupus nephritis. The patients had a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to American College of Rheumatology classification criteria; biopsy-proven lupus nephritis Class III, IV, and/or V; and had active renal disease at screening requiring standard therapy: corticosteroids with 1) mycophenolate for induction followed by mycophenolate for maintenance, or 2) cyclophosphamide for induction followed by azathioprine for maintenance.

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "In a multicenter, open-label study, Schulz A. et al evaluated the effect of intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in pediatric patients with CLN2. The primary outcome compared the duration until a 2-point decline in the score on the motor and language domains of the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale in study patients to the rate of decline in 42 historical controls. In addition, the rate of decline in the motor-language score was compared between the two groups. Of the 24 patients enrolled, 23 constituted the efficacy population. The median time until a 2-point decline in the motor-language score was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls. The mean (±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per 48-week period was 0.27 ±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12 ±0.98 points in 42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P < 0.001). Common adverse events included convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure of the intraventricular device. Infections developed in the intraventricular device for administration in 2 patients, required antibiotic treatment and device replacement. The authors conclude that intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 disease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in historical controls.\nClinical evidence for the safety and efficacy of cerliponase alfa for the treatment of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) was demonstrated in a prospective Phase 1/2 Open-Label Dose-Escalation Study and Extension. The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cerliponase alfa administered to patients with CLN2 disease by intraventricular administration. There were 5 study centers involved. Patients were treated with intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa with doses ranging from 30 to 300 mg every 14 days in the dose escalation study and were maintained at 300 mg every 14 days in the extension study. The primary endpoint was response rate, defined as the absence of an unreversed two-point decline or score of zero in the CLN2 score at 48 weeks. 24 patients were enrolled, with 23 patients completing the study. By motor/language CLN2 scores measured from baseline, 87% (20/23) of treated patients responded to treatment, defined as an absence of an unreversed two-point decline or score of zero by Week 48, compared to an expected response rate of 50% (P-value = 0.0002). Sixty-five percent of treated patients experienced no progression in their CLN2 score. Of all points lost, approximately 80% occurred within four months of treatment initiation. The proportion of patients with a response to treatment was 87% at Week 48 and 63% at Week 96.\nThe efficacy of Brineura for the treatment of CLN2 disease in all children, either symptomatic or presymptomatic, is supported by data from Study 190-203, a phase 2, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating Brineura treatment over the span of approximately three years in children aged 1-6 years at baseline, including eight children less than 3 years of age. Results from Study 190-203 demonstrated that intraventricular-administered Brineura slowed the decline in motor function and delayed disease onset in children with CLN2 disease, including those who were under 3 years of age. In addition to confirming that treatment initiated after 3 years of age significantly slows the progression of CLN2 disease, data also demonstrated early treatment initiation before 3 years of age may result in delaying disease onset. Study 190-203 used the CLN2 Clinical Rating Scale to assess for decline in the motor domain in children. The domain measures ambulation, with normal function being a score of three and no function being a score of zero. Decline was defined in the study as having a sustained two-point loss or score of zero that is irreversible. In the children below 3 years of age treated with Brineura, none (0%) had a two-point decline or score of zero in the motor score by the final assessment (week 169). Seven of the eight treated children were matched to 18 untreated children from a natural history cohort. Among the natural history comparators, 11 children (61%) experienced an unreversed two-point decline or score of zero by the final assessment. From baseline to final assessment, all seven matched Brineura-treated children below 3 years of age maintained a motor score of three, which represents a grossly normal gait, signifying a delay in disease onset.",

    "summary": "Cosentyx (secukinumab) is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the interleukin-17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). UHC covers Cosentyx IV when it is medically reasonable and necessary, and the patient or caregiver are not able to be trained or are physically unable to administer Cosentyx FDA labeled for self-administration. For PsA, AS, and nr-axSpA, initial and continuation therapy require that the patient is not receiving Cosentyx in combination with a targeted immunomodulator. For PsA, patients must have a history of failure to methotrexate or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator. For AS and nr-axSpA, patients must have a history of failure to two NSAIDs or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator. Cosentyx is unproven and not medically necessary for plaque psoriasis, enthesitis-related arthritis, and hidradenitis suppurativa. The effectiveness of intravenous Cosentyx was extrapolated from the established effectiveness of subcutaneous Cosentyx based on pharmacokinetic exposure. Initial and continued authorization is for 12 months. Policy updates include the addition of Bimzelx to the list of targeted immunomodulators.",

    "summary": "Cosentyx (secukinumab) is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the interleukin-17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). UHC covers Cosentyx IV when it is medically reasonable and necessary, and the patient or caregiver are not able to be trained or are physically unable to administer Cosentyx FDA labeled for self-administration. For PsA, AS, and nr-axSpA, initial and continuation therapy require that the patient is not receiving Cosentyx in combination with a targeted immunomodulator. For PsA, patients must have a history of failure to methotrexate or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator. For AS and nr-axSpA, patients must have a history of failure to two NSAIDs or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator. Cosentyx is unproven and not medically necessary for plaque psoriasis, enthesitis-related arthritis, and hidradenitis suppurativa. The effectiveness of intravenous Cosentyx was extrapolated from the established effectiveness of subcutaneous Cosentyx based on pharmacokinetic exposure. Initial and continued authorization is for 12 months. Policy updates include the addition of Bimzelx to the list of targeted immunomodulators.",

    "summary": "Cosentyx (secukinumab) is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the interleukin-17A (IL-17A) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-17 receptor. It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). UHC covers Cosentyx IV when it is medically reasonable and necessary, and the patient or caregiver are not able to be trained or are physically unable to administer Cosentyx FDA labeled for self-administration. For PsA, AS, and nr-axSpA, initial and continuation therapy require that the patient is not receiving Cosentyx in combination with a targeted immunomodulator. For PsA, patients must have a history of failure to methotrexate or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator. For AS and nr-axSpA, patients must have a history of failure to two NSAIDs or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator. Cosentyx is unproven and not medically necessary for plaque psoriasis, enthesitis-related arthritis, and hidradenitis suppurativa. The effectiveness of intravenous Cosentyx was extrapolated from the established effectiveness of subcutaneous Cosentyx based on pharmacokinetic exposure. Initial and continued authorization is for 12 months. Policy updates include the addition of Bimzelx to the list of targeted immunomodulators.",

It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). UHC covers Cosentyx IV when it is medically reasonable and necessary, and the patient or caregiver are not able to be trained or are physically unable to administer Cosentyx FDA labeled for self-administration. For PsA, AS, and nr-axSpA, initial and continuation therapy require that the patient is not receiving Cosentyx in combination with a targeted immunomodulator. For PsA, patients must have a history of failure to methotrexate or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator. For AS and nr-axSpA, patients must have a history of failure to two NSAIDs or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator. Cosentyx is unproven and not medically necessary for plaque psoriasis, enthesitis-related arthritis, and hidradenitis suppurativa. The effectiveness of intravenous Cosentyx was extrapolated from the established effectiveness of subcutaneous Cosentyx based on pharmacokinetic exposure. Initial and continued authorization is for 12 months. Policy updates include the addition of Bimzelx to the list of targeted immunomodulators.",

For the primary endpoint at week 40, patients in the burosumab group had significantly greater improvement in Radiographic Global Impression of Change global score than did patients in the conventional therapy group (least squares mean + 1.9 [SE 0.1] with burosumab vs + 0.8 [0.1] with conventional therapy; difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.5; p < 0.0001).\nA randomized, open-label study (NCT 02163577) in 52 prepubescent XLH patients compared burosumab administered every 2 weeks versus every 4 weeks. After 40 weeks of therapy, mean total RSS decreased from 1.9 to 0.8 and the mean RGI-C Global score was + 1.7 in patients receiving burosumab every two weeks. Eighteen out of 26 patients achieved an RGI-C score of ≥ + 2.0. These findings were maintained at week 64.\nA 64-week open-label study (NCT 02750618) was conducted in 13 XLH patients age 1 to 4 years old. At week 40, patients experienced an increased mean (SD) serum phosphorus levels from 2.5 (0.28) mg/dL at baseline to 3.5 (0.49) mg/d. After 40 weeks of treatment, mean total RSS decreased from 2.9 to 1.2 and the mean (SE) RGI-C Global score was + 2.3 (0.08). All 13 patients achieved an RGI-C global score ≥ + 2.0.

Through week 24, a total of 94% of patients receiving burosumab achieved a serum phosphorus level above the lower limit of normal compared to 8% in the placebo group. Assessment of active fracture/pseudofractures at week 24 demonstrated a higher rate of complete healing in the group receiving burosumab compared to placebo.\nA 48-week, open-label, single-arm study (NCT 02537431) was completed in 14 adult XLH patients to determine the effects of burosumab on improvement of osteomalacia as based on histologic and histomorphometric evaluation of iliac crest bone biopsies. After 48 weeks of treatment, healing of osteomalacia was observed in ten patients as demonstrated by decreases in Osteoid volume/Bone volume from a mean (SD) score of 26% (12.4) at baseline to 11% (6.5), a change of -57%.

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "The efficacy of Elevidys was evaluated in three studies: the EMBARK Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, confirmatory trial; a Phase II study; and a Phase Ib study.\n\nClinical Trial SRP-9001-102 (NCT03769116):\nStudy 102 is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter, 2-part study in 41 ambulatory individuals with DMD with either a confirmed frameshift mutation, or a premature stop codon mutation between exons 18 to 58 in the DMD gene. All participants were 4 years or older and less than 8 years of age at time of infusion in Part 1. The primary objectives of this 3-part study were to evaluate micro-dystrophin expression at 12 weeks as measured by western blot of biopsied muscle tissue expressed as a percent of control (levels of dystrophin in normal participants without DMD or Becker muscular dystrophy [BMD]) and to evaluate the effect of Elevidys on physical function as assessed by the NSAA over 48 weeks.\n\nIn Part 1, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a single intravenous infusion of Elevidys (n = 20) or placebo (n = 21). The study met its primary biological endpoint of micro-dystrophin protein expression. At Week 12 of Study 102 Part 1, the mean (SD) change from baseline levels of micro-dystrophin (% of control) were 3.6 (5.7), 28.2 (52.2), and 43.4 (48.6) for participants receiving Elevidys-dose level 1 (DL1), Elevidys-dose level 2 (DL2), and Elevidys-dose level 3 (DL3), respectively. The study did not demonstrate a statistically significant change in NSAA from baseline to Week 48 after treatment. A subgroup analysis to further evaluate the treatment effect of Elevidys on NSAA scores from baseline to Week 48 stratified participants into two age groups: 4-5 years old and 6-7 years old. The exploratory subgroup analyses demonstrated that for individuals in the age 4-5 years cohort, the least square (LS) mean changes (standard error [SE]) in NSAA total score from baseline to Week 48 were 4.3 (0.7) and 1.9 (0.7) points for the ELEVIDYS and placebo group, respectively. For participants 6-7 years of age, the LS mean changes (SE) in NSAA total score from baseline to Week 48 were -0.2 (0.7) and 0.5 (0.7) points for the ELEVIDYS and placebo group, respectively.\n\nIn Part 2, which was also blinded, participants who received placebo in Part 1 received Elevidys and those that had previously received Elevidys received a placebo infusion. All participants were followed for another 48 weeks while safety and efficacy were evaluated. Two participants with substantially high micro-dystrophin baseline values were excluded from analysis. At Week 12 of Part 2, the mean (SD) change from baseline levels of the micro-dystrophin (% of control) were 10.6 (17.0), 10.4 (14.7), and 43.5 (55.6) for participants receiving Elevidys-dose level 1, Elevidys-DL2 dose level 2, and Elevidys-dose level 3, respectively. Elevidys-treated participants from the placebo crossover group (n = 20, aged 5-8 at time of dosing Elevidys) scored a statistically significant 2.0 points higher on the mean NSAA at 48 weeks compared to propensity-score weighted external controls (p value = 0.0009). Mean NSAA scores from these Part 2 participants improved 1.3 points from baseline for the Elevidys-treated group, and the NSAA scores in the external control group (n = 103) declined 0.7 points from baseline. The mean age of the participants who received Elevidys was 7.24 years of age.\n\nClinical Trial SRP-9001-103 (NCT04626674, ENDEAVOR Trial)\nStudy 103 (ENDEAVOR) is an ongoing, single-arm, open-label, Phase 1b study evaluating over a 5-year (260 weeks) period of time the safety of and expression of micro-dystrophin from Elevidys in males at least 3 years of age with DMD. The study enrolled male patients across cohorts based on ambulatory status (ambulatory or non-ambulatory) and age group. The primary outcome is the change from baseline in the quantity of micro-dystrophin protein expression at week 12 as measured by western blot. Estimated study completion date is January 2028. Currently, only data from cohort 1 is available which included 20 ambulatory males, aged 4 through 7 years. At week 12, mean (SD) change from baseline in micro-dystrophin expression as measured by western blot was 54.2% (42.6); p < 0.0001.\n\nClinical Trial SRP-9001-301 (NCT05096221, EMBARK Trial)\nThe EMBARK trial is a global Phase 3, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, Part 1 and a 52-week crossover Part 2. Participants randomized to the placebo arm in Part 1 had the opportunity to receive treatment in Part 2. The trial included 125 ambulatory male patients aged 4 through 7 years. The least square mean change in NSAA total score from baseline to Week 52 between the Elevidys (n = 63) and placebo groups (n = 61) was not statistically significant (p = 0.2441). The least square mean changes in NSAA total score from baseline to Week 52 was 2.57 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.80, 3.34) points for the Elevidys group and 1.92 (95% CI: 1.14, 2.70) points for the placebo group, with a LS mean difference from placebo of 0.65 (95% CI: -0.45, 1.74).",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "The efficacy of Encelto was evaluated in two phase 3 studies involving subjects between 21 years and 80 years of age who have idiopathic macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel).\n\nStudy 1 was a randomized, multi-center, sham-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy of Encelto subretinal injection in MacTel patients over 24 months. To be enrolled, patients needed a photoreceptor IS/OS PR break in the ellipsoid zone (EZ) between 0.16 and 2.00 mm² and a best corrected visual acuity of 20/50 or better. A total of 115 patients were randomized into two groups: Encelto (58 patients) and sham (57 patients). The primary endpoint was the rate of change in EZ area loss (IS/OS, macular PR loss) from baseline to month 24, while the secondary outcome measure was the mean change in aggregate sensitivity loss of microperimetry within the EZ break area from baseline to month 24. The mean age was 61 years (range 40 to 78 years), the majority of patients were female (69%) and white (85%). The median (min, max) baseline EZ area loss was 0.35 (0.15, 1.99) mm2 for the Encelto group and 0.36 (0.16, 1.7) mm2 for the sham group. The median (min, max) baseline aggregate sensitivity of microperimetry within the EZ break area 35.2 (0.75, 398.8) dB for the Encelto group and 35.5 (2, 281.3) dB for the sham group. At month 24, there was a statistically significant difference in the rate of change EZ area loss between groups: 0.075 mm2 and 0.166 mm2 with Encelto and sham, respectively (difference - 0.091, 95% CI: -0.13, -0.06; p < 0.0001). This demonstrated that Encelto was superior to sham in slowing the rate of retinal disease progression over a period of 24 months. There was no statistically significant differences in the mean change in aggregate retinal sensitivity loss from baseline to 24 months: 25.27 and 43.02 with Encelto and Sham, respectively (difference -17.5, 95% CI: -32.58, -2.91); p < 0.02).\n\nStudy 2 was a randomized, multi-center, sham-controlled study which enrolled adult with MacTel. For enrollment, the patients were required to have an IS/OS PR break in EZ between 0.16 and 2.00 mm2 measured by Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) and Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of 54-letter score or better (20/80 or better) as measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart at screening. Patients with neovascular MacTel were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive either Encelto intravitreal implant or sham procedure under standard peri-operative procedures. The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in the area of EZ loss over 24 month, while the secondary outcome measure was the mean change in aggregate sensitivity loss of microperimetry within the EZ break area from baseline to month 24. A total of 113 patients were randomized into two groups Encelto (59 patients) and sham (44 patients).The mean age was 59 years (range: 40 to 75 years), the majority of patients were female (73%), and white (90%). The median (min, max) baseline EZ area loss was 0.48 (0.16, 1.63) mm2 for Encelto and 0.39 (0.16, 1.38) mm2 for the sham group. The median (min, max) baseline aggregate sensitivity of microperimetry within the EZ break area 40.07 (4.82, 291.52) dB for the Encelto group and 28.86 (0.33, 221.17) dB for the sham group. At month 24, there was a statistically significant difference in the rate of change in EZ area loss from baseline over 24 months: 0.111 mm2 and 0.160 mm2 with Encelto and Sham, respectively (difference -0.049, 95% CI: - 0.089, -0.008; p < 0.0186). This demonstrated that Encelto was superior to sham in slowing the rate of retinal disease progression over a period of 24 months. There was no statistically significant differences in the mean change in aggregate retinal sensitivity loss from baseline to 24 months: 40.02 and 41.97 with Encelto and Sham, respectively (difference -1.95, 95% CI: -20.33, 16.43); p < 0.83).",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Sutimlimab was studied in a 26-week open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase 3 CARDINAL study (Part A) with a 2-year extension phase (Part B). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CAD based on chronic hemolysis, polyspecific DAT, monospecific DAT specific for C3d, cold agglutinin titer ≥ 64 at 4°C, and IgG DAT ≤ 1 + were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included baseline hemoglobin (Hb) ≤ 10 g/dL, total bilirubin level above normal, and ≥ 1 blood transfusion in the prior 6 months. Sutimlimab was administered intravenously on Days 0 and 7, followed by biweekly infusions. Patients weighing < 75 kg or ≥ 75 kg received a 6.5 g or 7.5 g dose, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was response rate based on a composite of Hb increase ≥ 2 g/dL or Hb ≥ 12 g/dL at treatment assessment and transfusion avoidance from Weeks 5 to 26. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline in hemolytic markers (e.g., bilirubin) and quality of life (QOL) measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scale.\nTwenty-four patients enrolled and received ≥ 1 dose of sutimlimab. The mean (standard deviation) age was 71.3 (8.2) years with 62.5% females. Mean (range) baseline Hb was 8.6 (4.9-11.1) g/dL. The median (range) number of transfusions within 6 months prior to enrollment was 2 (1-19) and 62.5% of patients had failed prior therapies. Out of 24 patients, 22 completed Part A; 2 patients were withdrawn early for reasons unrelated to the study drug. The prespecified primary endpoint was met in 13 (54.2%) patients. The estimated mean Hb increase at treatment assessment time point was 3.2 g/dL. Hb improved rapidly after the first dose of sutimlimab with 1.2 g/dL and 2.3 g/dL increases by Weeks 1 and 3, respectively. Mean overall Hb was maintained above 11 g/dL after Week 3. Twenty (83.3%) patients had a Hb increase ≥ 1 g/dL. Fifteen (63%) patients had a Hb increase ≥ 2 g/dL. Nine (38%) of patients had a Hb level of ≥ 12 g/dL. Mean total bilirubin was normalized by Week 3. Seventeen (70.8%) patients remained free of transfusions from Weeks 5 to 26.\nFACIT-F scores improved within 1 week, peaking by Week 5, and remained stable through Week 26.\nThe efficacy of sutimlimab was assessed in a 6-month placebo-controlled CADENZA trial in 42 patients. Following the completion of the 6-month treatment period (Part A) in which 22 patients received sutimlimab and 20 patients received placebo, 39 patients (19 patients on sutimlimab and 20 patients on placebo) continued to receive sutimlimab in a long-term safety and durability of response extension phase (Part B) for an additional 12 months following last patient out from Part A. The trial included a 9-week safety follow-up after the last dose of sutimlimab. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CAD based on chronic hemolysis, polyspecific direct antiglobulin test (DAT), monospecific DAT specific for C3d, cold agglutinin titer ≥ 64 at 4°C, an IgG DAT ≤ 1 + and no history of transfusion within 6 months, or more than one blood transfusion in the 12 months prior to enrollment in the trial. Efficacy was based on the proportion of patients (responders) who met the following criteria: an increase from baseline in hemoglobin level ≥ 1.5 g/dL at the treatment assessment time point (mean value from weeks 23, 25, and 26), no blood transfusion from week 5 through week 26, and no treatment for CAD beyond what was permitted per protocol from week 5 through week 26. The responder rate was 72.7% with Enjaymo and 15% with placebo (treatment difference 58.78, 95% CI: 34.6, 82.96; p = 0.0004). The most common adverse reactions (≥ 18%) were rhinitis, headache, hypertension, acrocyanosis, and Raynaud’s phenomenon.",

    "summary": "Entyvio (vedolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that reduces chronically inflamed gastrointestinal parenchymal tissue associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. UHC covers Entyvio for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities and GI acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) when specific criteria are met, including diagnosis of moderately to severely active disease, failure or intolerance to conventional therapies, and lack of concurrent use with other targeted immunomodulators. Initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with reauthorization requiring documentation of positive clinical response. The American College of Gastroenterology and American Gastroenterological Association guidelines support the use of vedolizumab in these conditions. Entyvio is administered intravenously and is dosed according to FDA-labeled guidelines. The policy was updated on July 1, 2025, to include coverage for GI acute graft-versus-host disease and revise criteria for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities.",

    "summary": "Entyvio (vedolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that reduces chronically inflamed gastrointestinal parenchymal tissue associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. UHC covers Entyvio for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities and GI acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) when specific criteria are met, including diagnosis of moderately to severely active disease, failure or intolerance to conventional therapies, and lack of concurrent use with other targeted immunomodulators. Initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with reauthorization requiring documentation of positive clinical response. The American College of Gastroenterology and American Gastroenterological Association guidelines support the use of vedolizumab in these conditions. Entyvio is administered intravenously and is dosed according to FDA-labeled guidelines. The policy was updated on July 1, 2025, to include coverage for GI acute graft-versus-host disease and revise criteria for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities.",

The study randomly assigned 65 patients, 12 years of age and older, with HoFH who were already stable on lipid-lowering therapy (e.g., maximally tolerated statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies, lomitapide, and lipoprotein apheresis), in a 2:1 ratio to receive evinacumab or placebo. Most of the trial patients (94%) were receiving a statin (a high-intensity statin in 77%). Additionally, a PCSK9 inhibitor was being administered in 77% of the patients, ezetimibe in 75%, and lomitapide in 25%; 34% of the patients were undergoing apheresis. A total of 63% of the patients were taking at least three lipid modifying drugs. 43 patients were randomized to receive evinacumab 15 mg/kg every 4 weeks and 22 patients to receive placebo. After the double-blind treatment period, 64 of 65 patients entered a 24-week open-label extension period where all patients received evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the percent change from baseline in the LDL cholesterol level at week 24. The mean baseline LDL-C was 255 mg/dL. At week 24, the relative risk reduction from baseline was 47.1% in those treated with evinacumab, compared to an increase of 1.9% in the placebo group for a between-group least-squares mean (LSM) difference of -49.0 percentage points (95% CI: -65.0, -33.1; p < 0.001). The between-group LSM absolute difference in the LDL-C level was -132.1 mg/dL (95% CI: -175.3, -88.9; p < 0.001).\n\nThe approval of Evkeeza for the expanded indication in patients aged 5 years and older was based on a three-part, single-arm, open-label study (NCT04233918) in 14 pediatric patients aged 5 to 11 years with HoFH. Part B of this trial evaluated the efficacy of Evkeeza every 4 weeks as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, lomitapide, and lipoprotein apheresis) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to week 24. At week 24, the mean percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline was -48% (95% CI: -69% to -28%).",

The study randomly assigned 65 patients, 12 years of age and older, with HoFH who were already stable on lipid-lowering therapy (e.g., maximally tolerated statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies, lomitapide, and lipoprotein apheresis), in a 2:1 ratio to receive evinacumab or placebo. Most of the trial patients (94%) were receiving a statin (a high-intensity statin in 77%). Additionally, a PCSK9 inhibitor was being administered in 77% of the patients, ezetimibe in 75%, and lomitapide in 25%; 34% of the patients were undergoing apheresis. A total of 63% of the patients were taking at least three lipid modifying drugs. 43 patients were randomized to receive evinacumab 15 mg/kg every 4 weeks and 22 patients to receive placebo. After the double-blind treatment period, 64 of 65 patients entered a 24-week open-label extension period where all patients received evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the percent change from baseline in the LDL cholesterol level at week 24. The mean baseline LDL-C was 255 mg/dL. At week 24, the relative risk reduction from baseline was 47.1% in those treated with evinacumab, compared to an increase of 1.9% in the placebo group for a between-group least-squares mean (LSM) difference of -49.0 percentage points (95% CI: -65.0, -33.1; p < 0.001).

Part B of this trial evaluated the efficacy of Evkeeza every 4 weeks as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, lomitapide, and lipoprotein apheresis) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to week 24. At week 24, the mean percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline was -48% (95% CI: -69% to -28%).",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, and ferumoxytol are indicated for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron or who have chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nDe Franceschi et al, published a systematic review on the advances in diagnosis and treatment in the clinical management of iron deficiency anemia in adults. The eligible studies show that serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are the key tests in early decision-making process to identify iron deficiency anemia (IDA). For the treatment of IDA, the analysis observed the following outcomes:\n• The choice on iron supplementation is based on Hgb levels, the tolerance to oral iron supplementation and the presence of concomitant disease, which might affect iron absorption.\n• Intravenous iron administration is definitively more effective in correction of ID since it by-passes the iron absorption step. It offers advantages over oral iron such as:\n\t○ Rapid repletion of iron stores;\n\t○ Single dose sufficient for most of the new IV formulation with a reduction in hospital visits.\n• Follow-up schedule of iron-supplementation therapy is based on the evaluation of Hgb levels at 4 weeks of treatment.\n• Day 14 Hgb levels have been proposed in decision-making process to move patient from oral to IV administration in case of failure.\n• In CKD, iron oral supplementation is recommended in patients with IDA not receiving ESAs and not on hemodialysis (HD).\n• IV iron should be proposed to patients on ESAs treatment and/or on HD, based on the evidence that oral iron does not sufficiently support ESAs stimulated erythropoiesis.\n• Iron supplementation should be always considered as part of clinical management of CHF patients.\n• In iron restricted iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) patients, oral iron administration usually does not solve the problem, whereas IV iron temporally ameliorates this condition. Ferritin levels could be reduced or normal after iron treatment.\n\nPeyrin-Biroulet and colleagues performed a systematic review of guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across several indications. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin. One-half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended preferentially the oral route, if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or post-pregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10–12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin > 100 µg/L (n = 7) or 200 µg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, ferritin concentrations should not exceed 500 µg/L (n = 5) or 800 µg/L (n = 5).

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, and ferumoxytol are indicated for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adult patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron or who have chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nDe Franceschi et al, published a systematic review on the advances in diagnosis and treatment in the clinical management of iron deficiency anemia in adults. The eligible studies show that serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are the key tests in early decision-making process to identify iron deficiency anemia (IDA). For the treatment of IDA, the analysis observed the following outcomes:\n• The choice on iron supplementation is based on Hgb levels, the tolerance to oral iron supplementation and the presence of concomitant disease, which might affect iron absorption.\n• Intravenous iron administration is definitively more effective in correction of ID since it by-passes the iron absorption step. It offers advantages over oral iron such as:\n\t○ Rapid repletion of iron stores;\n\t○ Single dose sufficient for most of the new IV formulation with a reduction in hospital visits.\n• Follow-up schedule of iron-supplementation therapy is based on the evaluation of Hgb levels at 4 weeks of treatment.\n• Day 14 Hgb levels have been proposed in decision-making process to move patient from oral to IV administration in case of failure.\n• In CKD, iron oral supplementation is recommended in patients with IDA not receiving ESAs and not on hemodialysis (HD).\n• IV iron should be proposed to patients on ESAs treatment and/or on HD, based on the evidence that oral iron does not sufficiently support ESAs stimulated erythropoiesis.\n• Iron supplementation should be always considered as part of clinical management of CHF patients.\n• In iron restricted iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) patients, oral iron administration usually does not solve the problem, whereas IV iron temporally ameliorates this condition. Ferritin levels could be reduced or normal after iron treatment.\n\nPeyrin-Biroulet and colleagues performed a systematic review of guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across several indications. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin. One-half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended preferentially the oral route, if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or post-pregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10–12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin > 100 µg/L (n = 7) or 200 µg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, ferritin concentrations should not exceed 500 µg/L (n = 5) or 800 µg/L (n = 5). Only 9 guidelines recommended TSAT as a target, proposing various thresholds ranging from 20% to 50%.",

Inclusion criteria specified a minimum of 2 porphyria attacks requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or intravenous hemin administration at home in the 6 months prior to study entry. Hemin use during the study was permitted for the treatment of acute porphyria attacks. Patients were randomized to receive Givlaari or placebo during the 6-month double-blind period. Efficacy in the 6-month double-blind period was measured by the rate of porphyria attacks that required hospitalizations, urgent healthcare visit, or intravenous hemin administration at home. The mean rate of porphyria attacks was 1.9 and 6.5 for Givlaari and placebo, respectively. This represented a 70% (95% CI: 60, 80) reduction in porphyria attacks for patients receiving Givlaari vs. placebo. The mean number of days of hemin use was 4.7 (95% CI: 2.8, 7.9) with Givlaari vs. 12.8 (95% CI: 7.6, 21.4) with placebo.",

    "summary": "Givlaari (givosiran) is used for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP) in adults. UHC covers Givlaari for patients with a diagnosis of AHP who meet specific criteria, including having active disease (at least 2 documented porphyria attacks within the past 6 months) or currently receiving prophylactic hemin. Patients must not have had a liver transplant and must not receive concomitant prophylactic hemin treatment while on Givlaari. The prescribing provider must be a hematologist or a specialist with expertise in the diagnosis and management of AHPs. Initial authorization is for no more than 12 months. For continuation therapy, patients must have previously received Givlaari for AHP and have documentation of a positive clinical response. The Givlaari dosing must be in accordance with FDA approved labeling. The efficacy of Givlaari was demonstrated in the Phase 3 ENVISION trial, which showed a 70% reduction in porphyria attacks compared to placebo. The policy was updated on 04/01/2025 to reflect current clinical evidence.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "*   Kuemmerle-Deschner et al (2011) assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in a multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study in in patients with cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome. In the study, 85 of 109 canakinumab-naive patients (78%; 79/85 patients within 8 days, and five patients between days 10 and 21) achieved complete response. In the 141 patients who were assessed for relapse, 90% did not relapse, and experienced normalization of CRP/SAA levels (< 10 mg/l) by day 8, which were sustained.\n*   Lachmann et al (2009) evaluated the use of use of canakinumab in the cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome in a three-part, 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. In part 1 of the study, complete response was achieved by 34 out of 35 patients (97%).\n*   The efficacy and safety of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of canakinumab in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. The proportion of patients who were responders for the primary outcome at week 16 was significantly higher with canakinumab than that with placebo for all 3 disease cohorts.\n*   Ahmet et al conducted an open-label pilot study to investigate the efficacy of canakinumab in FMF patients. All the included patients, in the treatment period achieved the primary endpoint of ≥ 50 % reduction in frequency of attacks compared with the time-adjusted pre-treatment frequency of attacks.\n*   Ruperto et al. conducted an open-label active treatment extension study, which enrolled SJIA patients, previously treated with canakinumab in phase III trials as well as those who did not. In the trial, the proportion of patients with inactive disease increased over time, from 32.7% at baseline to 49.0% at the last assessment.\n*   Ruperto et al conducted 2 phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of SJIA. In trial 1, 36 of 43 (84%) patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15 compared to the placebo group, for which 4 of 41 (10%) P < 0.001 patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15. In trial 2, among the 100 patients (of 177 in the open-label phase) who underwent randomization in the withdrawal phase, the risk of flare was lower among patients who continued to receive canakinumab than among those who were switched to placebo (74% of patients in the canakinumab group had no flare, vs. 25% in the placebo group, according to Kaplan–Meier estimates; hazard ratio, 0.36; P = 0.003).\n*   Kedor et al conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with AOSD and active joint involvement. The primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, however, treatment of patient with AOSD and active joint involvement led to an improvement of ACR30, ACR 50% response and ACR 70% response, as well as disease activity score.\n*   The efficacy of Ilaris was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with gout flares for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, and who had experienced at least three gout flares in the previous year (Studies 1 and 2).",

    "summary": "Ilaris (canakinumab) is a recombinant human anti-human-IL-1 monoclonal antibody used to treat several autoinflammatory conditions and gout flares. UHC covers Ilaris for Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D (Hyper-IgD) syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and Gout flares when specific diagnostic and prior treatment criteria are met, as determined by a specialist. For most indications, initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of positive clinical response and adherence to FDA-approved dosing. For gout flares, authorization is for a single dose lasting 12 weeks, and patients must have contraindications or treatment failures with NSAIDs and colchicine, and be deemed inappropriate for systemic corticosteroids. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of canakinumab in reducing disease activity and flare frequency in these conditions. Ilaris is not covered for the management or treatment of cardiovascular disease. The policy was updated on December 1, 2024, to revise coverage criteria for Active Still’s Disease and to update clinical evidence.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "*   Kuemmerle-Deschner et al (2011) assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in a multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study in in patients with cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome. In the study, 85 of 109 canakinumab-naive patients (78%; 79/85 patients within 8 days, and five patients between days 10 and 21) achieved complete response. In the 141 patients who were assessed for relapse, 90% did not relapse, and experienced normalization of CRP/SAA levels (< 10 mg/l) by day 8, which were sustained.\n*   Lachmann et al (2009) evaluated the use of use of canakinumab in the cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome in a three-part, 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. In part 1 of the study, complete response was achieved by 34 out of 35 patients (97%).\n*   The efficacy and safety of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of canakinumab in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. The proportion of patients who were responders for the primary outcome at week 16 was significantly higher with canakinumab than that with placebo for all 3 disease cohorts.\n*   Ahmet et al conducted an open-label pilot study to investigate the efficacy of canakinumab in FMF patients. All the included patients, in the treatment period achieved the primary endpoint of ≥ 50 % reduction in frequency of attacks compared with the time-adjusted pre-treatment frequency of attacks.\n*   Ruperto et al. conducted an open-label active treatment extension study, which enrolled SJIA patients, previously treated with canakinumab in phase III trials as well as those who did not. In the trial, the proportion of patients with inactive disease increased over time, from 32.7% at baseline to 49.0% at the last assessment.\n*   Ruperto et al conducted 2 phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of SJIA. In trial 1, 36 of 43 (84%) patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15 compared to the placebo group, for which 4 of 41 (10%) P < 0.001 patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15. In trial 2, among the 100 patients (of 177 in the open-label phase) who underwent randomization in the withdrawal phase, the risk of flare was lower among patients who continued to receive canakinumab than among those who were switched to placebo (74% of patients in the canakinumab group had no flare, vs. 25% in the placebo group, according to Kaplan–Meier estimates; hazard ratio, 0.36; P = 0.003).\n*   Kedor et al conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with AOSD and active joint involvement. The primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, however, treatment of patient with AOSD and active joint involvement led to an improvement of ACR30, ACR 50% response and ACR 70% response, as well as disease activity score.\n*   The efficacy of Ilaris was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with gout flares for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, and who had experienced at least three gout flares in the previous year (Studies 1 and 2).",

    "summary": "Ilaris (canakinumab) is a recombinant human anti-human-IL-1 monoclonal antibody used to treat several autoinflammatory conditions and gout flares. UHC covers Ilaris for Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D (Hyper-IgD) syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and Gout flares when specific diagnostic and prior treatment criteria are met, as determined by a specialist. For most indications, initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of positive clinical response and adherence to FDA-approved dosing. For gout flares, authorization is for a single dose lasting 12 weeks, and patients must have contraindications or treatment failures with NSAIDs and colchicine, and be deemed inappropriate for systemic corticosteroids. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of canakinumab in reducing disease activity and flare frequency in these conditions. Ilaris is not covered for the management or treatment of cardiovascular disease. The policy was updated on December 1, 2024, to revise coverage criteria for Active Still’s Disease and to update clinical evidence.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "*   Kuemmerle-Deschner et al (2011) assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in a multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study in in patients with cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome. In the study, 85 of 109 canakinumab-naive patients (78%; 79/85 patients within 8 days, and five patients between days 10 and 21) achieved complete response. In the 141 patients who were assessed for relapse, 90% did not relapse, and experienced normalization of CRP/SAA levels (< 10 mg/l) by day 8, which were sustained.\n*   Lachmann et al (2009) evaluated the use of use of canakinumab in the cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome in a three-part, 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. In part 1 of the study, complete response was achieved by 34 out of 35 patients (97%).\n*   The efficacy and safety of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of canakinumab in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. The proportion of patients who were responders for the primary outcome at week 16 was significantly higher with canakinumab than that with placebo for all 3 disease cohorts.\n*   Ahmet et al conducted an open-label pilot study to investigate the efficacy of canakinumab in FMF patients. All the included patients, in the treatment period achieved the primary endpoint of ≥ 50 % reduction in frequency of attacks compared with the time-adjusted pre-treatment frequency of attacks.\n*   Ruperto et al. conducted an open-label active treatment extension study, which enrolled SJIA patients, previously treated with canakinumab in phase III trials as well as those who did not. In the trial, the proportion of patients with inactive disease increased over time, from 32.7% at baseline to 49.0% at the last assessment.\n*   Ruperto et al conducted 2 phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of SJIA. In trial 1, 36 of 43 (84%) patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15 compared to the placebo group, for which 4 of 41 (10%) P < 0.001 patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15. In trial 2, among the 100 patients (of 177 in the open-label phase) who underwent randomization in the withdrawal phase, the risk of flare was lower among patients who continued to receive canakinumab than among those who were switched to placebo (74% of patients in the canakinumab group had no flare, vs. 25% in the placebo group, according to Kaplan–Meier estimates; hazard ratio, 0.36; P = 0.003).\n*   Kedor et al conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with AOSD and active joint involvement. The primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, however, treatment of patient with AOSD and active joint involvement led to an improvement of ACR30, ACR 50% response and ACR 70% response, as well as disease activity score.\n*   The efficacy of Ilaris was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with gout flares for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, and who had experienced at least three gout flares in the previous year (Studies 1 and 2).",

    "summary": "Ilaris (canakinumab) is a recombinant human anti-human-IL-1 monoclonal antibody used to treat several autoinflammatory conditions and gout flares. UHC covers Ilaris for Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D (Hyper-IgD) syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and Gout flares when specific diagnostic and prior treatment criteria are met, as determined by a specialist. For most indications, initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of positive clinical response and adherence to FDA-approved dosing. For gout flares, authorization is for a single dose lasting 12 weeks, and patients must have contraindications or treatment failures with NSAIDs and colchicine, and be deemed inappropriate for systemic corticosteroids. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of canakinumab in reducing disease activity and flare frequency in these conditions. Ilaris is not covered for the management or treatment of cardiovascular disease. The policy was updated on December 1, 2024, to revise coverage criteria for Active Still’s Disease and to update clinical evidence.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "*   Kuemmerle-Deschner et al (2011) assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in a multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study in in patients with cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome. In the study, 85 of 109 canakinumab-naive patients (78%; 79/85 patients within 8 days, and five patients between days 10 and 21) achieved complete response. In the 141 patients who were assessed for relapse, 90% did not relapse, and experienced normalization of CRP/SAA levels (< 10 mg/l) by day 8, which were sustained.\n*   Lachmann et al (2009) evaluated the use of use of canakinumab in the cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome in a three-part, 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. In part 1 of the study, complete response was achieved by 34 out of 35 patients (97%).\n*   The efficacy and safety of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of canakinumab in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. The proportion of patients who were responders for the primary outcome at week 16 was significantly higher with canakinumab than that with placebo for all 3 disease cohorts.\n*   Ahmet et al conducted an open-label pilot study to investigate the efficacy of canakinumab in FMF patients. All the included patients, in the treatment period achieved the primary endpoint of ≥ 50 % reduction in frequency of attacks compared with the time-adjusted pre-treatment frequency of attacks.\n*   Ruperto et al. conducted an open-label active treatment extension study, which enrolled SJIA patients, previously treated with canakinumab in phase III trials as well as those who did not. In the trial, the proportion of patients with inactive disease increased over time, from 32.7% at baseline to 49.0% at the last assessment.\n*   Ruperto et al conducted 2 phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of SJIA. In trial 1, 36 of 43 (84%) patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15 compared to the placebo group, for which 4 of 41 (10%) P < 0.001 patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15. In trial 2, among the 100 patients (of 177 in the open-label phase) who underwent randomization in the withdrawal phase, the risk of flare was lower among patients who continued to receive canakinumab than among those who were switched to placebo (74% of patients in the canakinumab group had no flare, vs. 25% in the placebo group, according to Kaplan–Meier estimates; hazard ratio, 0.36; P = 0.003).\n*   Kedor et al conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with AOSD and active joint involvement. The primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, however, treatment of patient with AOSD and active joint involvement led to an improvement of ACR30, ACR 50% response and ACR 70% response, as well as disease activity score.\n*   The efficacy of Ilaris was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with gout flares for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, and who had experienced at least three gout flares in the previous year (Studies 1 and 2).",

    "summary": "Ilaris (canakinumab) is a recombinant human anti-human-IL-1 monoclonal antibody used to treat several autoinflammatory conditions and gout flares. UHC covers Ilaris for Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D (Hyper-IgD) syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and Gout flares when specific diagnostic and prior treatment criteria are met, as determined by a specialist. For most indications, initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of positive clinical response and adherence to FDA-approved dosing. For gout flares, authorization is for a single dose lasting 12 weeks, and patients must have contraindications or treatment failures with NSAIDs and colchicine, and be deemed inappropriate for systemic corticosteroids. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of canakinumab in reducing disease activity and flare frequency in these conditions. Ilaris is not covered for the management or treatment of cardiovascular disease. The policy was updated on December 1, 2024, to revise coverage criteria for Active Still’s Disease and to update clinical evidence.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "*   Kuemmerle-Deschner et al (2011) assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in a multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study in in patients with cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome. In the study, 85 of 109 canakinumab-naive patients (78%; 79/85 patients within 8 days, and five patients between days 10 and 21) achieved complete response. In the 141 patients who were assessed for relapse, 90% did not relapse, and experienced normalization of CRP/SAA levels (< 10 mg/l) by day 8, which were sustained.\n*   Lachmann et al (2009) evaluated the use of use of canakinumab in the cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome in a three-part, 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. In part 1 of the study, complete response was achieved by 34 out of 35 patients (97%).\n*   The efficacy and safety of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of canakinumab in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. The proportion of patients who were responders for the primary outcome at week 16 was significantly higher with canakinumab than that with placebo for all 3 disease cohorts.\n*   Ahmet et al conducted an open-label pilot study to investigate the efficacy of canakinumab in FMF patients. All the included patients, in the treatment period achieved the primary endpoint of ≥ 50 % reduction in frequency of attacks compared with the time-adjusted pre-treatment frequency of attacks.\n*   Ruperto et al. conducted an open-label active treatment extension study, which enrolled SJIA patients, previously treated with canakinumab in phase III trials as well as those who did not. In the trial, the proportion of patients with inactive disease increased over time, from 32.7% at baseline to 49.0% at the last assessment.\n*   Ruperto et al conducted 2 phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of SJIA. In trial 1, 36 of 43 (84%) patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15 compared to the placebo group, for which 4 of 41 (10%) P < 0.001 patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15. In trial 2, among the 100 patients (of 177 in the open-label phase) who underwent randomization in the withdrawal phase, the risk of flare was lower among patients who continued to receive canakinumab than among those who were switched to placebo (74% of patients in the canakinumab group had no flare, vs. 25% in the placebo group, according to Kaplan–Meier estimates; hazard ratio, 0.36; P = 0.003).\n*   Kedor et al conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with AOSD and active joint involvement. The primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, however, treatment of patient with AOSD and active joint involvement led to an improvement of ACR30, ACR 50% response and ACR 70% response, as well as disease activity score.\n*   The efficacy of Ilaris was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with gout flares for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, and who had experienced at least three gout flares in the previous year (Studies 1 and 2).",

    "summary": "Ilaris (canakinumab) is a recombinant human anti-human-IL-1 monoclonal antibody used to treat several autoinflammatory conditions and gout flares. UHC covers Ilaris for Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D (Hyper-IgD) syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and Gout flares when specific diagnostic and prior treatment criteria are met, as determined by a specialist. For most indications, initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of positive clinical response and adherence to FDA-approved dosing. For gout flares, authorization is for a single dose lasting 12 weeks, and patients must have contraindications or treatment failures with NSAIDs and colchicine, and be deemed inappropriate for systemic corticosteroids. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of canakinumab in reducing disease activity and flare frequency in these conditions. Ilaris is not covered for the management or treatment of cardiovascular disease. The policy was updated on December 1, 2024, to revise coverage criteria for Active Still’s Disease and to update clinical evidence.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "*   Kuemmerle-Deschner et al (2011) assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in a multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study in in patients with cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome. In the study, 85 of 109 canakinumab-naive patients (78%; 79/85 patients within 8 days, and five patients between days 10 and 21) achieved complete response. In the 141 patients who were assessed for relapse, 90% did not relapse, and experienced normalization of CRP/SAA levels (< 10 mg/l) by day 8, which were sustained.\n*   Lachmann et al (2009) evaluated the use of use of canakinumab in the cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome in a three-part, 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. In part 1 of the study, complete response was achieved by 34 out of 35 patients (97%).\n*   The efficacy and safety of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of canakinumab in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. The proportion of patients who were responders for the primary outcome at week 16 was significantly higher with canakinumab than that with placebo for all 3 disease cohorts.\n*   Ahmet et al conducted an open-label pilot study to investigate the efficacy of canakinumab in FMF patients. All the included patients, in the treatment period achieved the primary endpoint of ≥ 50 % reduction in frequency of attacks compared with the time-adjusted pre-treatment frequency of attacks.\n*   Ruperto et al. conducted an open-label active treatment extension study, which enrolled SJIA patients, previously treated with canakinumab in phase III trials as well as those who did not. In the trial, the proportion of patients with inactive disease increased over time, from 32.7% at baseline to 49.0% at the last assessment.\n*   Ruperto et al conducted 2 phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of SJIA. In trial 1, 36 of 43 (84%) patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15 compared to the placebo group, for which 4 of 41 (10%) P < 0.001 patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15. In trial 2, among the 100 patients (of 177 in the open-label phase) who underwent randomization in the withdrawal phase, the risk of flare was lower among patients who continued to receive canakinumab than among those who were switched to placebo (74% of patients in the canakinumab group had no flare, vs. 25% in the placebo group, according to Kaplan–Meier estimates; hazard ratio, 0.36; P = 0.003).\n*   Kedor et al conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with AOSD and active joint involvement. The primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, however, treatment of patient with AOSD and active joint involvement led to an improvement of ACR30, ACR 50% response and ACR 70% response, as well as disease activity score.\n*   The efficacy of Ilaris was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with gout flares for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, and who had experienced at least three gout flares in the previous year (Studies 1 and 2).",

    "summary": "Ilaris (canakinumab) is a recombinant human anti-human-IL-1 monoclonal antibody used to treat several autoinflammatory conditions and gout flares. UHC covers Ilaris for Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D (Hyper-IgD) syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and Gout flares when specific diagnostic and prior treatment criteria are met, as determined by a specialist. For most indications, initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of positive clinical response and adherence to FDA-approved dosing. For gout flares, authorization is for a single dose lasting 12 weeks, and patients must have contraindications or treatment failures with NSAIDs and colchicine, and be deemed inappropriate for systemic corticosteroids. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of canakinumab in reducing disease activity and flare frequency in these conditions. Ilaris is not covered for the management or treatment of cardiovascular disease. The policy was updated on December 1, 2024, to revise coverage criteria for Active Still’s Disease and to update clinical evidence.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "*   Kuemmerle-Deschner et al (2011) assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in a multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study in in patients with cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome. In the study, 85 of 109 canakinumab-naive patients (78%; 79/85 patients within 8 days, and five patients between days 10 and 21) achieved complete response. In the 141 patients who were assessed for relapse, 90% did not relapse, and experienced normalization of CRP/SAA levels (< 10 mg/l) by day 8, which were sustained.\n*   Lachmann et al (2009) evaluated the use of use of canakinumab in the cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome in a three-part, 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. In part 1 of the study, complete response was achieved by 34 out of 35 patients (97%).\n*   The efficacy and safety of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of canakinumab in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. The proportion of patients who were responders for the primary outcome at week 16 was significantly higher with canakinumab than that with placebo for all 3 disease cohorts.\n*   Ahmet et al conducted an open-label pilot study to investigate the efficacy of canakinumab in FMF patients. All the included patients, in the treatment period achieved the primary endpoint of ≥ 50 % reduction in frequency of attacks compared with the time-adjusted pre-treatment frequency of attacks.\n*   Ruperto et al. conducted an open-label active treatment extension study, which enrolled SJIA patients, previously treated with canakinumab in phase III trials as well as those who did not. In the trial, the proportion of patients with inactive disease increased over time, from 32.7% at baseline to 49.0% at the last assessment.\n*   Ruperto et al conducted 2 phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of SJIA. In trial 1, 36 of 43 (84%) patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15 compared to the placebo group, for which 4 of 41 (10%) P < 0.001 patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15. In trial 2, among the 100 patients (of 177 in the open-label phase) who underwent randomization in the withdrawal phase, the risk of flare was lower among patients who continued to receive canakinumab than among those who were switched to placebo (74% of patients in the canakinumab group had no flare, vs. 25% in the placebo group, according to Kaplan–Meier estimates; hazard ratio, 0.36; P = 0.003).\n*   Kedor et al conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with AOSD and active joint involvement. The primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, however, treatment of patient with AOSD and active joint involvement led to an improvement of ACR30, ACR 50% response and ACR 70% response, as well as disease activity score.\n*   The efficacy of Ilaris was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with gout flares for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, and who had experienced at least three gout flares in the previous year (Studies 1 and 2).",

    "summary": "Ilaris (canakinumab) is a recombinant human anti-human-IL-1 monoclonal antibody used to treat several autoinflammatory conditions and gout flares. UHC covers Ilaris for Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D (Hyper-IgD) syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and Gout flares when specific diagnostic and prior treatment criteria are met, as determined by a specialist. For most indications, initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of positive clinical response and adherence to FDA-approved dosing. For gout flares, authorization is for a single dose lasting 12 weeks, and patients must have contraindications or treatment failures with NSAIDs and colchicine, and be deemed inappropriate for systemic corticosteroids. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of canakinumab in reducing disease activity and flare frequency in these conditions. Ilaris is not covered for the management or treatment of cardiovascular disease. The policy was updated on December 1, 2024, to revise coverage criteria for Active Still’s Disease and to update clinical evidence.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "*   Kuemmerle-Deschner et al (2011) assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in a multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study in in patients with cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome. In the study, 85 of 109 canakinumab-naive patients (78%; 79/85 patients within 8 days, and five patients between days 10 and 21) achieved complete response. In the 141 patients who were assessed for relapse, 90% did not relapse, and experienced normalization of CRP/SAA levels (< 10 mg/l) by day 8, which were sustained.\n*   Lachmann et al (2009) evaluated the use of use of canakinumab in the cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome in a three-part, 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. In part 1 of the study, complete response was achieved by 34 out of 35 patients (97%).\n*   The efficacy and safety of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of canakinumab in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. The proportion of patients who were responders for the primary outcome at week 16 was significantly higher with canakinumab than that with placebo for all 3 disease cohorts.\n*   Ahmet et al conducted an open-label pilot study to investigate the efficacy of canakinumab in FMF patients. All the included patients, in the treatment period achieved the primary endpoint of ≥ 50 % reduction in frequency of attacks compared with the time-adjusted pre-treatment frequency of attacks.\n*   Ruperto et al. conducted an open-label active treatment extension study, which enrolled SJIA patients, previously treated with canakinumab in phase III trials as well as those who did not. In the trial, the proportion of patients with inactive disease increased over time, from 32.7% at baseline to 49.0% at the last assessment.\n*   Ruperto et al conducted 2 phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of SJIA. In trial 1, 36 of 43 (84%) patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15 compared to the placebo group, for which 4 of 41 (10%) P < 0.001 patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15. In trial 2, among the 100 patients (of 177 in the open-label phase) who underwent randomization in the withdrawal phase, the risk of flare was lower among patients who continued to receive canakinumab than among those who were switched to placebo (74% of patients in the canakinumab group had no flare, vs. 25% in the placebo group, according to Kaplan–Meier estimates; hazard ratio, 0.36; P = 0.003).\n*   Kedor et al conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with AOSD and active joint involvement. The primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, however, treatment of patient with AOSD and active joint involvement led to an improvement of ACR30, ACR 50% response and ACR 70% response, as well as disease activity score.\n*   The efficacy of Ilaris was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with gout flares for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, and who had experienced at least three gout flares in the previous year (Studies 1 and 2).",

    "summary": "Ilaris (canakinumab) is a recombinant human anti-human-IL-1 monoclonal antibody used to treat several autoinflammatory conditions and gout flares. UHC covers Ilaris for Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D (Hyper-IgD) syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and Gout flares when specific diagnostic and prior treatment criteria are met, as determined by a specialist. For most indications, initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of positive clinical response and adherence to FDA-approved dosing. For gout flares, authorization is for a single dose lasting 12 weeks, and patients must have contraindications or treatment failures with NSAIDs and colchicine, and be deemed inappropriate for systemic corticosteroids. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of canakinumab in reducing disease activity and flare frequency in these conditions. Ilaris is not covered for the management or treatment of cardiovascular disease. The policy was updated on December 1, 2024, to revise coverage criteria for Active Still’s Disease and to update clinical evidence.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "*   Kuemmerle-Deschner et al (2011) assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in a multinational, open-label, single treatment arm study in in patients with cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome. In the study, 85 of 109 canakinumab-naive patients (78%; 79/85 patients within 8 days, and five patients between days 10 and 21) achieved complete response. In the 141 patients who were assessed for relapse, 90% did not relapse, and experienced normalization of CRP/SAA levels (< 10 mg/l) by day 8, which were sustained.\n*   Lachmann et al (2009) evaluated the use of use of canakinumab in the cryopyrin- associated periodic syndrome in a three-part, 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study of canakinumab in patients with CAPS. In part 1 of the study, complete response was achieved by 34 out of 35 patients (97%).\n*   The efficacy and safety of Ilaris for the treatment of TRAPS, HIDS/MKD, and FMF were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of canakinumab in patients with FMF, HIDS/MKD or TRAPS. The proportion of patients who were responders for the primary outcome at week 16 was significantly higher with canakinumab than that with placebo for all 3 disease cohorts.\n*   Ahmet et al conducted an open-label pilot study to investigate the efficacy of canakinumab in FMF patients. All the included patients, in the treatment period achieved the primary endpoint of ≥ 50 % reduction in frequency of attacks compared with the time-adjusted pre-treatment frequency of attacks.\n*   Ruperto et al. conducted an open-label active treatment extension study, which enrolled SJIA patients, previously treated with canakinumab in phase III trials as well as those who did not. In the trial, the proportion of patients with inactive disease increased over time, from 32.7% at baseline to 49.0% at the last assessment.\n*   Ruperto et al conducted 2 phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab for the treatment of SJIA. In trial 1, 36 of 43 (84%) patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15 compared to the placebo group, for which 4 of 41 (10%) P < 0.001 patients had an adapted JIA ACR 30 response at day 15. In trial 2, among the 100 patients (of 177 in the open-label phase) who underwent randomization in the withdrawal phase, the risk of flare was lower among patients who continued to receive canakinumab than among those who were switched to placebo (74% of patients in the canakinumab group had no flare, vs. 25% in the placebo group, according to Kaplan–Meier estimates; hazard ratio, 0.36; P = 0.003).\n*   Kedor et al conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with AOSD and active joint involvement. The primary endpoint did not achieve statistical significance, however, treatment of patient with AOSD and active joint involvement led to an improvement of ACR30, ACR 50% response and ACR 70% response, as well as disease activity score.\n*   The efficacy of Ilaris was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with gout flares for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective, and who had experienced at least three gout flares in the previous year (Studies 1 and 2).",

    "summary": "Ilaris (canakinumab) is a recombinant human anti-human-IL-1 monoclonal antibody used to treat several autoinflammatory conditions and gout flares. UHC covers Ilaris for Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D (Hyper-IgD) syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and Gout flares when specific diagnostic and prior treatment criteria are met, as determined by a specialist. For most indications, initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of positive clinical response and adherence to FDA-approved dosing. For gout flares, authorization is for a single dose lasting 12 weeks, and patients must have contraindications or treatment failures with NSAIDs and colchicine, and be deemed inappropriate for systemic corticosteroids. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of canakinumab in reducing disease activity and flare frequency in these conditions. Ilaris is not covered for the management or treatment of cardiovascular disease. The policy was updated on December 1, 2024, to revise coverage criteria for Active Still’s Disease and to update clinical evidence.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "FDA approval for donanemab was based on TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 1, NCT04437511) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (patients with confirmed presence of amyloid pathology and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, consistent with Stage 3 and Stage 4 Alzheimer's disease). Patients were enrolled with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥ 20 and ≤ 28 and had a progressive change in memory function for at least 6 months. Patients were included in the study based on visual assessment of tau PET imaging with flortaucipir and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR).\nIn TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, 1736 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 700 mg of donanemab every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, and then 1400 mg every 4 weeks (N = 860) or placebo (N = 876) for a total of up to 72 weeks. The treatment was switched to placebo based on amyloid PET levels measured at Week 24, Week 52, and Week 76. At baseline, mean age was 73 years, with a range of 59 to 86 years. Of the total number of patients randomized, 68% had low/medium tau level and 32% had high tau level; 71% were ApoE 4 carriers and 29% were ApoE 4 noncarriers. Fifty-seven percent of patients were female, 91% were White, 6% were Asian, 4% were Hispanic or Latino, and 2% were Black or African American.\nPatients treated with donanemab demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in clinical decline on iADRS compared to placebo at Week 76 in the combined population [difference, 2.92 (95% CI, 1.51-4.33); P <.001] and the low/medium tau population [difference, 3.25 (95% CI, 1.88-4.62); P <.001]. Patients treated with donanemab demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in clinical decline on CDR-SB compared to placebo at Week 7 6 in the combined population [difference, -0.7 (95% CI, -0.95 to -0.45); P<.001]. There were also statistically significant differences (P < 0.001) between treatment groups as measured by ADAS-Cog13 and ADCS-iADL at Week 76.",

    "summary": "Kisunla (donanemab-azbt) is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against insoluble N-truncated pyroglutamate amyloid beta, indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. UHC covers Kisunla for patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, based on NIA-AA criteria. Coverage requires documentation of specific CDR scores, MMSE/MoCA/SLUMS scores, and positive amyloid PET scans. Other dementias must be ruled out. Patients on anticoagulants require counseling. A baseline MRI is needed. Kisunla is not used with other Aβ monoclonal antibodies and must be prescribed by a dementia specialist. Initial authorization is for 6 months, with continuation based on maintained cognitive scores and amyloid PET scan results. The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial demonstrated statistically significant reduction in clinical decline on iADRS and CDR-SB compared to placebo at Week 76. Kisunla is considered unproven and not medically necessary for indications other than mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia. The policy was updated on 07/01/2025 to add a Benefit Considerations section and on 01/01/2025 to remove a reference link.",

The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, −0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.67 to −0.23; p < 0.001). Furthermore, a slope analysis demonstrated that lecanemab took 5.5 to 6 months more time to achieve the same CDR-SB as placebo at 18 months, indicating a 5.5 to 6 month slowing of progression. A plaque reduction was a secondary endpoint and was studied in a subset of patients (n = 698). The adjusted mean change from baseline at 18 months was -55.48 centiloids in the lecanemab group vs 3.64 centiloids in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, -59.12 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.64 to -55.60; p < 0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusions in 12.6%. The incidence of ARIA-E with lecanemab was 12.5% vs 1.7% with placebo (symptomatic ARIA-E: 2.8% vs 0% with placebo). The incidence of ARIA-H was 17.0% vs 8.7% with placebo (symptomatic ARIA-H: 0.7% vs 0.2% in placebo group). Other mean differences between the two groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the ADAS-cog14 score, −1.44 (95% CI, −2.27 to −0.61; p < 0.001); for the ADCOMS, −0.050 (95% CI, −0.074 to −0.027; p < 0.001); and for the ADCS-MCIADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; p < 0.001).",

    "summary": "Leqembi (lecanemab-irmb) is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid beta and is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. UHC covers Leqembi for patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia who meet specific diagnostic and cognitive criteria, have confirmed beta-amyloid protein deposition, have ruled out other potential diagnoses, and meet other requirements related to anticoagulant use, history of intracerebral hemorrhage, counseling on ARIA risks and ApoE ε4 status, and brain MRI completion. The patient must not be using other Aβ monoclonal antibodies. Initial authorization is for 6 months, with continuation requiring ongoing fulfillment of diagnostic and cognitive criteria, MRI follow-up, and prescriber attestation regarding ARIA and symptom severity. The CLARITY AD Phase 3 study demonstrated the superiority of lecanemab compared with placebo on the change from baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) at 18 months of treatment. Reauthorization is for no more than 12 months. There are no explicit exclusion criteria mentioned for Leqembi in this document.",

UnitedHealthcare covers Leqvio for patients with a diagnosis of HeFH, ASCVD, or primary hyperlipidemia who meet specific criteria. These criteria include documentation of prior treatment with PCSK9 therapy or at least 12 weeks of high-intensity statin therapy, or intolerance to high-intensity statins with at least 12 weeks of low- or moderate-intensity statin therapy, or contraindication/intolerance to all statins and a history of failure/contraindication/intolerance to PCSK9 therapy, and LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL. Leqvio must be prescribed by a cardiologist, endocrinologist, or lipid specialist and cannot be used in combination with PCSK9 inhibitors. Initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of a positive clinical response. Clinical evidence from trials like ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11 demonstrates that inclisiran significantly reduces LDL-C levels in patients with HeFH and those at high cardiovascular risk. The policy was updated on August 1, 2025, to revise the coverage criteria for initial therapy and continuation of therapy, including allowing coverage for patients previously treated with PCSK9 therapy and requiring that Leqvio be prescribed by a specialist.",

    "summary": "Leqvio (inclisiran) is a medication used to treat primary hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), in adults. UnitedHealthcare covers Leqvio for patients with a diagnosis of HeFH, ASCVD, or primary hyperlipidemia who meet specific criteria. These criteria include documentation of prior treatment with PCSK9 therapy or at least 12 weeks of high-intensity statin therapy, or intolerance to high-intensity statins with at least 12 weeks of low- or moderate-intensity statin therapy, or contraindication/intolerance to all statins and a history of failure/contraindication/intolerance to PCSK9 therapy, and LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL. Leqvio must be prescribed by a cardiologist, endocrinologist, or lipid specialist and cannot be used in combination with PCSK9 inhibitors. Initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of a positive clinical response. Clinical evidence from trials like ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11 demonstrates that inclisiran significantly reduces LDL-C levels in patients with HeFH and those at high cardiovascular risk. The policy was updated on August 1, 2025, to revise the coverage criteria for initial therapy and continuation of therapy, including allowing coverage for patients previously treated with PCSK9 therapy and requiring that Leqvio be prescribed by a specialist.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Phase 1 trials, done at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, showed safe and stable improvement in retinal and visual function in all 12 participants. Most of these participants showed improved light sensitivity, navigational abilities, or visual acuity. A follow-on study, in which 11 of these 12 participants underwent injection of the contralateral eye at the dose of 1·5 × 10¹¹ vg, demonstrated the safety of contralateral eye injection, as well as gains in visual and retinal function in the second eye. This improvement has remained durable over at least 3 years, with observation ongoing.\n\nThe efficacy of voretigene neparvovec in pediatric and adult patients with biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy was evaluated in an open-lable, two-center, randomized trial. Of the 31 enrolled subjects, 21 subjects with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to either the voretigene neparvovec group or control group and followed for one year. After completion of one year of observation, control subjects were allowed to crossover and receive voretigene neparvovec treatment. Enrollment criteria include the following: subjects had to be at least three years of age with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations, subjects had to have a visual acuity of worse than or equal to 20/60 (for both eyes) and/or visual field of less than 20 degrees in any meridian as measured by a GVF III4e isopter or equivalent (both eyes), subjects had to have sufficient viable retinal cells as determined by non-invasive means, such as OCT (defined as an area of retina within the posterior pole of > 100 microns thickness) or ophthalmoscopy, subjects had to have the ability to comprehend the MLMT, follow course instructions, and the capacity to successfully navigate the course, and subjects had to have a baseline score on the MLMT that would allow a measurable improvement to be observed. The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline at Year 1 in multi-luminance mobility test (MLMT) performance using the bilateral testing condition of the intervention group compared to controls. A total of 29 subjects were randomized and received intervention, 20 to the intervention arm and 9 to control. Overall, 72% of all treated subjects (21 of 29) achieved the maximum possible MLMT improvement one-year post-administration, demonstrating significant improvement in functional vision at lower light levels. The benefits observed at one year in the original intervention group continued through at least two years post-administration, with observation ongoing.",

Secondary endpoints included endoscopic improvement, maintenance of clinical remission, corticosteroid-free clinical remission, and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement.\n  *  In UC-1, after 12 weeks of induction, 65% of patients achieved clinical response and 24% achieved clinical remission compared to placebo (43% and 15%, respectively).\n  *  In UC-2, among those who achieved clinical response at 12 weeks, 51% of all patients and 45% of patients who failed prior treatment with a biologic or Janus kinase inhibitor achieved clinical remission at 52 weeks compared to placebo (27% and 15%, respectively). 50% achieved steroid-free clinical remission at 52 weeks, compared to 27% of patients receiving placebo. Among patients who achieved clinical remission at 12 weeks, 66% of patients maintained clinical remission through 1 year of continuous treatment compared 40% of patients receiving placebo.\n\n• Crohn's Disease:\n  *  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [CD-1 (NCT03926130)] in adult subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who had an inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to corticosteroids, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate), and/or biologics (TNF blockers, integrin receptor antagonists).\n  *  In CD-1, subjects were randomized to receive mirikizumab-mrkz 900 mg by intravenous infusion at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8 followed by a dosage of 300 mg by subcutaneous injection at Week 12 and then every 4 weeks for 40 weeks, or placebo. The coprimary endpoints of clinical remission by CDAI and endoscopic response by SES-CD were assessed at Week 52. Secondary efficacy endpoints included endoscopic response at Week 12 and endoscopic remission and corticosteroid-free clinical remission at Week 52.\n  *  In CD-1, a greater proportion of subjects treated with mirikizumab-mrkz compared to placebo achieved clinical remission (34% versus 23%) and endoscopic remission (10% versus 4%) at Week 12.",

    "summary": "Omvoh (mirikizumab-mrkz) is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of human IL-23 cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. It is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in adults.\n\nFor Ulcerative Colitis, UHC covers Omvoh when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and is receiving the drug as three intravenous induction doses, with dosing in accordance with FDA labeled dosing. The patient must not be receiving Omvoh in combination with another targeted immunomodulator. For medical necessity, the patient must have had prior or concurrent inadequate response to a therapeutic course of oral corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants, OR has been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator FDA-approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. It must be prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist, and authorization will be issued for 3 induction doses.\n\nFor Crohn’s Disease, UHC covers Omvoh when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease and is receiving the drug as three intravenous induction doses, with dosing in accordance with FDA labeled dosing. The patient must not be receiving Omvoh in combination with another targeted immunomodulator. For medical necessity, the patient must have a history of failure to one of the following conventional therapies at up to maximally indicated doses unless contraindicated or clinically significant adverse effects are experienced: Corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine, Azathioprine, Methotrexate, OR has been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator FDA-approved for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. It must be prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist, and authorization will be issued for 3 induction doses.\n\nClinical evidence includes data from studies UC-1, UC-2, and CD-1, which demonstrated the efficacy and safety of mirikizumab-mrkz in treating ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The policy was updated on 05/01/2025 to include coverage criteria for Crohn’s disease.",

Coverage is based on whether Orencia is proven or medically necessary for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. The criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, concomitant medication restrictions, and the need for positive clinical response. The authorization duration is generally limited to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses.

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Clinical evidence includes:\n\n*   **Psoriatic Arthritis:** A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial showed that abatacept significantly increased ACR20 response versus placebo at week 24 (39.4% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001). The benefits were seen regardless of TNF inhibitor exposure, and efficacy was maintained or improved up to week 52. The impact on psoriasis lesions was modest.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** A Phase 3b double-blind study compared subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) abatacept in patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). At month 6, 76.0% of SC abatacept-treated patients versus 75.8% of IV abatacept-treated patients achieved an ACR20 response, confirming noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept. The Assessing Very Early Rheumatoid arthritis Treatment (AVERT) trial demonstrated that abatacept plus MTX showed efficacy compared with MTX alone in early RA, with a comparable safety profile to MTX.\n*   **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:** A Phase 3, open-label study showed that subcutaneous abatacept in patients with PJIA achieved JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, or 100 responses or had inactive disease responses at month 4. Improvements were sustained to month 24. The long-term extension (LTE) phase of a pivotal phase III study reported that long-term abatacept therapy, for up to 7 years, was associated with consistent safety, efficacy, and quality of life benefits in patients with JIA.\n*   **Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease:** In a multicenter clinical study (GVHD-1), abatacept, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX), was evaluated in patients age 6 years and older who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor (URD). The GVHD-2 study analyzed outcomes of abatacept in combination with a CNI and MTX, versus a CNI and MTX alone, for the prophylaxis of aGVHD, in patients 6 years of age or older who underwent HSCT from a 1 allele-mismatched URD between 2011 and 2018. The OS rate at Day 180 in the abatacept plus CNI and MTX group was 98% and the OS rate at Day 180 in the CNI and MTX group was 75%.",

    "summary": "Orencia (abatacept) is a medication used to treat several conditions, including polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. UHC's coverage criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, and concomitant medication restrictions. For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, patients must have moderately to severely active disease and meet specific criteria for initial and continuation therapy, including not receiving Orencia in combination with other targeted immunomodulators. For chronic GVHD, patients must have steroid-refractory disease and be receiving Orencia in combination with systemic corticosteroids or be intolerant to systemic corticosteroid therapy. For aGVHD prophylaxis, patients must be at least 2 years old and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor, receiving Orencia in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate. For immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities, patients must have recently received checkpoint inhibitor therapy and have severe or life-threatening immunotherapy-related toxicities. The clinical evidence supporting Orencia's use includes studies demonstrating significant improvements in ACR20 response in psoriatic arthritis, noninferiority of subcutaneous abatacept to intravenous abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis, and sustained improvements in JIA-ACR responses in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. UHC generally limits authorization to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. Orencia is not covered for multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or uveitis associated with Behçet’s disease. The policy was updated on 2025-05-01 to replace references to “biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)” with “targeted immunomodulator” and to update the list of examples of targeted immunomodulators for psoriatic arthritis.",

    "rationale_for_use": "This policy outlines the coverage criteria for Orencia (abatacept) injection for intravenous infusion. Coverage is based on whether Orencia is proven or medically necessary for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. The criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, concomitant medication restrictions, and the need for positive clinical response. The authorization duration is generally limited to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. These criteria are designed to ensure that Orencia is used in accordance with FDA-labeled dosing and in clinically appropriate situations, as supported by clinical evidence and guidelines.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Clinical evidence includes:\n\n*   **Psoriatic Arthritis:** A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial showed that abatacept significantly increased ACR20 response versus placebo at week 24 (39.4% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001). The benefits were seen regardless of TNF inhibitor exposure, and efficacy was maintained or improved up to week 52. The impact on psoriasis lesions was modest.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** A Phase 3b double-blind study compared subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) abatacept in patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). At month 6, 76.0% of SC abatacept-treated patients versus 75.8% of IV abatacept-treated patients achieved an ACR20 response, confirming noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept. The Assessing Very Early Rheumatoid arthritis Treatment (AVERT) trial demonstrated that abatacept plus MTX showed efficacy compared with MTX alone in early RA, with a comparable safety profile to MTX.\n*   **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:** A Phase 3, open-label study showed that subcutaneous abatacept in patients with PJIA achieved JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, or 100 responses or had inactive disease responses at month 4. Improvements were sustained to month 24. The long-term extension (LTE) phase of a pivotal phase III study reported that long-term abatacept therapy, for up to 7 years, was associated with consistent safety, efficacy, and quality of life benefits in patients with JIA.\n*   **Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease:** In a multicenter clinical study (GVHD-1), abatacept, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX), was evaluated in patients age 6 years and older who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor (URD). The GVHD-2 study analyzed outcomes of abatacept in combination with a CNI and MTX, versus a CNI and MTX alone, for the prophylaxis of aGVHD, in patients 6 years of age or older who underwent HSCT from a 1 allele-mismatched URD between 2011 and 2018. The OS rate at Day 180 in the abatacept plus CNI and MTX group was 98% and the OS rate at Day 180 in the CNI and MTX group was 75%.",

    "summary": "Orencia (abatacept) is a medication used to treat several conditions, including polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. UHC's coverage criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, and concomitant medication restrictions. For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, patients must have moderately to severely active disease and meet specific criteria for initial and continuation therapy, including not receiving Orencia in combination with other targeted immunomodulators. For chronic GVHD, patients must have steroid-refractory disease and be receiving Orencia in combination with systemic corticosteroids or be intolerant to systemic corticosteroid therapy. For aGVHD prophylaxis, patients must be at least 2 years old and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor, receiving Orencia in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate. For immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities, patients must have recently received checkpoint inhibitor therapy and have severe or life-threatening immunotherapy-related toxicities. The clinical evidence supporting Orencia's use includes studies demonstrating significant improvements in ACR20 response in psoriatic arthritis, noninferiority of subcutaneous abatacept to intravenous abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis, and sustained improvements in JIA-ACR responses in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. UHC generally limits authorization to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. Orencia is not covered for multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or uveitis associated with Behçet’s disease. The policy was updated on 2025-05-01 to replace references to “biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)” with “targeted immunomodulator” and to update the list of examples of targeted immunomodulators for psoriatic arthritis.",

Coverage is based on whether Orencia is proven or medically necessary for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. The criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, concomitant medication restrictions, and the need for positive clinical response. The authorization duration is generally limited to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses.

The benefits were seen regardless of TNF inhibitor exposure, and efficacy was maintained or improved up to week 52. The impact on psoriasis lesions was modest.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** A Phase 3b double-blind study compared subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) abatacept in patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). At month 6, 76.0% of SC abatacept-treated patients versus 75.8% of IV abatacept-treated patients achieved an ACR20 response, confirming noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept. The Assessing Very Early Rheumatoid arthritis Treatment (AVERT) trial demonstrated that abatacept plus MTX showed efficacy compared with MTX alone in early RA, with a comparable safety profile to MTX.\n*   **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:** A Phase 3, open-label study showed that subcutaneous abatacept in patients with PJIA achieved JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, or 100 responses or had inactive disease responses at month 4. Improvements were sustained to month 24. The long-term extension (LTE) phase of a pivotal phase III study reported that long-term abatacept therapy, for up to 7 years, was associated with consistent safety, efficacy, and quality of life benefits in patients with JIA.\n*   **Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease:** In a multicenter clinical study (GVHD-1), abatacept, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX), was evaluated in patients age 6 years and older who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor (URD). The GVHD-2 study analyzed outcomes of abatacept in combination with a CNI and MTX, versus a CNI and MTX alone, for the prophylaxis of aGVHD, in patients 6 years of age or older who underwent HSCT from a 1 allele-mismatched URD between 2011 and 2018. The OS rate at Day 180 in the abatacept plus CNI and MTX group was 98% and the OS rate at Day 180 in the CNI and MTX group was 75%.",

    "summary": "Orencia (abatacept) is a medication used to treat several conditions, including polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. UHC's coverage criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, and concomitant medication restrictions. For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, patients must have moderately to severely active disease and meet specific criteria for initial and continuation therapy, including not receiving Orencia in combination with other targeted immunomodulators. For chronic GVHD, patients must have steroid-refractory disease and be receiving Orencia in combination with systemic corticosteroids or be intolerant to systemic corticosteroid therapy. For aGVHD prophylaxis, patients must be at least 2 years old and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor, receiving Orencia in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate. For immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities, patients must have recently received checkpoint inhibitor therapy and have severe or life-threatening immunotherapy-related toxicities. The clinical evidence supporting Orencia's use includes studies demonstrating significant improvements in ACR20 response in psoriatic arthritis, noninferiority of subcutaneous abatacept to intravenous abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis, and sustained improvements in JIA-ACR responses in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. UHC generally limits authorization to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. Orencia is not covered for multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or uveitis associated with Behçet’s disease. The policy was updated on 2025-05-01 to replace references to “biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)” with “targeted immunomodulator” and to update the list of examples of targeted immunomodulators for psoriatic arthritis.",

    "rationale_for_use": "This policy outlines the coverage criteria for Orencia (abatacept) injection for intravenous infusion. Coverage is based on whether Orencia is proven or medically necessary for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. The criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, concomitant medication restrictions, and the need for positive clinical response. The authorization duration is generally limited to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. These criteria are designed to ensure that Orencia is used in accordance with FDA-labeled dosing and in clinically appropriate situations, as supported by clinical evidence and guidelines.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Clinical evidence includes:\n\n*   **Psoriatic Arthritis:** A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial showed that abatacept significantly increased ACR20 response versus placebo at week 24 (39.4% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001). The benefits were seen regardless of TNF inhibitor exposure, and efficacy was maintained or improved up to week 52. The impact on psoriasis lesions was modest.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** A Phase 3b double-blind study compared subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) abatacept in patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). At month 6, 76.0% of SC abatacept-treated patients versus 75.8% of IV abatacept-treated patients achieved an ACR20 response, confirming noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept. The Assessing Very Early Rheumatoid arthritis Treatment (AVERT) trial demonstrated that abatacept plus MTX showed efficacy compared with MTX alone in early RA, with a comparable safety profile to MTX.\n*   **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:** A Phase 3, open-label study showed that subcutaneous abatacept in patients with PJIA achieved JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, or 100 responses or had inactive disease responses at month 4. Improvements were sustained to month 24. The long-term extension (LTE) phase of a pivotal phase III study reported that long-term abatacept therapy, for up to 7 years, was associated with consistent safety, efficacy, and quality of life benefits in patients with JIA.\n*   **Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease:** In a multicenter clinical study (GVHD-1), abatacept, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX), was evaluated in patients age 6 years and older who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor (URD). The GVHD-2 study analyzed outcomes of abatacept in combination with a CNI and MTX, versus a CNI and MTX alone, for the prophylaxis of aGVHD, in patients 6 years of age or older who underwent HSCT from a 1 allele-mismatched URD between 2011 and 2018. The OS rate at Day 180 in the abatacept plus CNI and MTX group was 98% and the OS rate at Day 180 in the CNI and MTX group was 75%.",

    "summary": "Orencia (abatacept) is a medication used to treat several conditions, including polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. UHC's coverage criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, and concomitant medication restrictions. For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, patients must have moderately to severely active disease and meet specific criteria for initial and continuation therapy, including not receiving Orencia in combination with other targeted immunomodulators. For chronic GVHD, patients must have steroid-refractory disease and be receiving Orencia in combination with systemic corticosteroids or be intolerant to systemic corticosteroid therapy. For aGVHD prophylaxis, patients must be at least 2 years old and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor, receiving Orencia in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate. For immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities, patients must have recently received checkpoint inhibitor therapy and have severe or life-threatening immunotherapy-related toxicities. The clinical evidence supporting Orencia's use includes studies demonstrating significant improvements in ACR20 response in psoriatic arthritis, noninferiority of subcutaneous abatacept to intravenous abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis, and sustained improvements in JIA-ACR responses in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. UHC generally limits authorization to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. Orencia is not covered for multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or uveitis associated with Behçet’s disease. The policy was updated on 2025-05-01 to replace references to “biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)” with “targeted immunomodulator” and to update the list of examples of targeted immunomodulators for psoriatic arthritis.",

Coverage is based on whether Orencia is proven or medically necessary for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. The criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, concomitant medication restrictions, and the need for positive clinical response. The authorization duration is generally limited to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. These criteria are designed to ensure that Orencia is used in accordance with FDA-labeled dosing and in clinically appropriate situations, as supported by clinical evidence and guidelines.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Clinical evidence includes:\n\n*   **Psoriatic Arthritis:** A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial showed that abatacept significantly increased ACR20 response versus placebo at week 24 (39.4% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001). The benefits were seen regardless of TNF inhibitor exposure, and efficacy was maintained or improved up to week 52. The impact on psoriasis lesions was modest.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** A Phase 3b double-blind study compared subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) abatacept in patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). At month 6, 76.0% of SC abatacept-treated patients versus 75.8% of IV abatacept-treated patients achieved an ACR20 response, confirming noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept. The Assessing Very Early Rheumatoid arthritis Treatment (AVERT) trial demonstrated that abatacept plus MTX showed efficacy compared with MTX alone in early RA, with a comparable safety profile to MTX.\n*   **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:** A Phase 3, open-label study showed that subcutaneous abatacept in patients with PJIA achieved JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, or 100 responses or had inactive disease responses at month 4. Improvements were sustained to month 24. The long-term extension (LTE) phase of a pivotal phase III study reported that long-term abatacept therapy, for up to 7 years, was associated with consistent safety, efficacy, and quality of life benefits in patients with JIA.\n*   **Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease:** In a multicenter clinical study (GVHD-1), abatacept, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX), was evaluated in patients age 6 years and older who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor (URD). The GVHD-2 study analyzed outcomes of abatacept in combination with a CNI and MTX, versus a CNI and MTX alone, for the prophylaxis of aGVHD, in patients 6 years of age or older who underwent HSCT from a 1 allele-mismatched URD between 2011 and 2018. The OS rate at Day 180 in the abatacept plus CNI and MTX group was 98% and the OS rate at Day 180 in the CNI and MTX group was 75%.",

    "summary": "Orencia (abatacept) is a medication used to treat several conditions, including polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. UHC's coverage criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, and concomitant medication restrictions. For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, patients must have moderately to severely active disease and meet specific criteria for initial and continuation therapy, including not receiving Orencia in combination with other targeted immunomodulators. For chronic GVHD, patients must have steroid-refractory disease and be receiving Orencia in combination with systemic corticosteroids or be intolerant to systemic corticosteroid therapy. For aGVHD prophylaxis, patients must be at least 2 years old and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor, receiving Orencia in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate. For immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities, patients must have recently received checkpoint inhibitor therapy and have severe or life-threatening immunotherapy-related toxicities. The clinical evidence supporting Orencia's use includes studies demonstrating significant improvements in ACR20 response in psoriatic arthritis, noninferiority of subcutaneous abatacept to intravenous abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis, and sustained improvements in JIA-ACR responses in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. UHC generally limits authorization to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. Orencia is not covered for multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or uveitis associated with Behçet’s disease. The policy was updated on 2025-05-01 to replace references to “biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)” with “targeted immunomodulator” and to update the list of examples of targeted immunomodulators for psoriatic arthritis.",

    "rationale_for_use": "This policy outlines the coverage criteria for Orencia (abatacept) injection for intravenous infusion. Coverage is based on whether Orencia is proven or medically necessary for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. The criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, concomitant medication restrictions, and the need for positive clinical response. The authorization duration is generally limited to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. These criteria are designed to ensure that Orencia is used in accordance with FDA-labeled dosing and in clinically appropriate situations, as supported by clinical evidence and guidelines.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Clinical evidence includes:\n\n*   **Psoriatic Arthritis:** A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial showed that abatacept significantly increased ACR20 response versus placebo at week 24 (39.4% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001). The benefits were seen regardless of TNF inhibitor exposure, and efficacy was maintained or improved up to week 52. The impact on psoriasis lesions was modest.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** A Phase 3b double-blind study compared subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) abatacept in patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). At month 6, 76.0% of SC abatacept-treated patients versus 75.8% of IV abatacept-treated patients achieved an ACR20 response, confirming noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept. The Assessing Very Early Rheumatoid arthritis Treatment (AVERT) trial demonstrated that abatacept plus MTX showed efficacy compared with MTX alone in early RA, with a comparable safety profile to MTX.\n*   **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:** A Phase 3, open-label study showed that subcutaneous abatacept in patients with PJIA achieved JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, or 100 responses or had inactive disease responses at month 4. Improvements were sustained to month 24. The long-term extension (LTE) phase of a pivotal phase III study reported that long-term abatacept therapy, for up to 7 years, was associated with consistent safety, efficacy, and quality of life benefits in patients with JIA.\n*   **Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease:** In a multicenter clinical study (GVHD-1), abatacept, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX), was evaluated in patients age 6 years and older who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor (URD). The GVHD-2 study analyzed outcomes of abatacept in combination with a CNI and MTX, versus a CNI and MTX alone, for the prophylaxis of aGVHD, in patients 6 years of age or older who underwent HSCT from a 1 allele-mismatched URD between 2011 and 2018. The OS rate at Day 180 in the abatacept plus CNI and MTX group was 98% and the OS rate at Day 180 in the CNI and MTX group was 75%.",

    "summary": "Orencia (abatacept) is a medication used to treat several conditions, including polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. UHC's coverage criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, and concomitant medication restrictions. For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, patients must have moderately to severely active disease and meet specific criteria for initial and continuation therapy, including not receiving Orencia in combination with other targeted immunomodulators. For chronic GVHD, patients must have steroid-refractory disease and be receiving Orencia in combination with systemic corticosteroids or be intolerant to systemic corticosteroid therapy. For aGVHD prophylaxis, patients must be at least 2 years old and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor, receiving Orencia in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate. For immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities, patients must have recently received checkpoint inhibitor therapy and have severe or life-threatening immunotherapy-related toxicities. The clinical evidence supporting Orencia's use includes studies demonstrating significant improvements in ACR20 response in psoriatic arthritis, noninferiority of subcutaneous abatacept to intravenous abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis, and sustained improvements in JIA-ACR responses in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. UHC generally limits authorization to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. Orencia is not covered for multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or uveitis associated with Behçet’s disease. The policy was updated on 2025-05-01 to replace references to “biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)” with “targeted immunomodulator” and to update the list of examples of targeted immunomodulators for psoriatic arthritis.",

    "rationale_for_use": "This policy outlines the coverage criteria for Orencia (abatacept) injection for intravenous infusion. Coverage is based on whether Orencia is proven or medically necessary for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. The criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, concomitant medication restrictions, and the need for positive clinical response. The authorization duration is generally limited to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. These criteria are designed to ensure that Orencia is used in accordance with FDA-labeled dosing and in clinically appropriate situations, as supported by clinical evidence and guidelines.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Clinical evidence includes:\n\n*   **Psoriatic Arthritis:** A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial showed that abatacept significantly increased ACR20 response versus placebo at week 24 (39.4% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001). The benefits were seen regardless of TNF inhibitor exposure, and efficacy was maintained or improved up to week 52. The impact on psoriasis lesions was modest.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** A Phase 3b double-blind study compared subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) abatacept in patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). At month 6, 76.0% of SC abatacept-treated patients versus 75.8% of IV abatacept-treated patients achieved an ACR20 response, confirming noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept. The Assessing Very Early Rheumatoid arthritis Treatment (AVERT) trial demonstrated that abatacept plus MTX showed efficacy compared with MTX alone in early RA, with a comparable safety profile to MTX.\n*   **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:** A Phase 3, open-label study showed that subcutaneous abatacept in patients with PJIA achieved JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, or 100 responses or had inactive disease responses at month 4. Improvements were sustained to month 24. The long-term extension (LTE) phase of a pivotal phase III study reported that long-term abatacept therapy, for up to 7 years, was associated with consistent safety, efficacy, and quality of life benefits in patients with JIA.\n*   **Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease:** In a multicenter clinical study (GVHD-1), abatacept, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX), was evaluated in patients age 6 years and older who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor (URD). The GVHD-2 study analyzed outcomes of abatacept in combination with a CNI and MTX, versus a CNI and MTX alone, for the prophylaxis of aGVHD, in patients 6 years of age or older who underwent HSCT from a 1 allele-mismatched URD between 2011 and 2018. The OS rate at Day 180 in the abatacept plus CNI and MTX group was 98% and the OS rate at Day 180 in the CNI and MTX group was 75%.",

    "summary": "Orencia (abatacept) is a medication used to treat several conditions, including polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. UHC's coverage criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, and concomitant medication restrictions. For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, patients must have moderately to severely active disease and meet specific criteria for initial and continuation therapy, including not receiving Orencia in combination with other targeted immunomodulators. For chronic GVHD, patients must have steroid-refractory disease and be receiving Orencia in combination with systemic corticosteroids or be intolerant to systemic corticosteroid therapy. For aGVHD prophylaxis, patients must be at least 2 years old and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor, receiving Orencia in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate. For immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities, patients must have recently received checkpoint inhibitor therapy and have severe or life-threatening immunotherapy-related toxicities. The clinical evidence supporting Orencia's use includes studies demonstrating significant improvements in ACR20 response in psoriatic arthritis, noninferiority of subcutaneous abatacept to intravenous abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis, and sustained improvements in JIA-ACR responses in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. UHC generally limits authorization to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. Orencia is not covered for multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or uveitis associated with Behçet’s disease. The policy was updated on 2025-05-01 to replace references to “biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)” with “targeted immunomodulator” and to update the list of examples of targeted immunomodulators for psoriatic arthritis.",

Coverage is based on whether Orencia is proven or medically necessary for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. The criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, concomitant medication restrictions, and the need for positive clinical response. The authorization duration is generally limited to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses.

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Clinical evidence includes:\n\n*   **Psoriatic Arthritis:** A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial showed that abatacept significantly increased ACR20 response versus placebo at week 24 (39.4% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001). The benefits were seen regardless of TNF inhibitor exposure, and efficacy was maintained or improved up to week 52. The impact on psoriasis lesions was modest.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** A Phase 3b double-blind study compared subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) abatacept in patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). At month 6, 76.0% of SC abatacept-treated patients versus 75.8% of IV abatacept-treated patients achieved an ACR20 response, confirming noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept. The Assessing Very Early Rheumatoid arthritis Treatment (AVERT) trial demonstrated that abatacept plus MTX showed efficacy compared with MTX alone in early RA, with a comparable safety profile to MTX.\n*   **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:** A Phase 3, open-label study showed that subcutaneous abatacept in patients with PJIA achieved JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, or 100 responses or had inactive disease responses at month 4. Improvements were sustained to month 24. The long-term extension (LTE) phase of a pivotal phase III study reported that long-term abatacept therapy, for up to 7 years, was associated with consistent safety, efficacy, and quality of life benefits in patients with JIA.\n*   **Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease:** In a multicenter clinical study (GVHD-1), abatacept, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX), was evaluated in patients age 6 years and older who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor (URD). The GVHD-2 study analyzed outcomes of abatacept in combination with a CNI and MTX, versus a CNI and MTX alone, for the prophylaxis of aGVHD, in patients 6 years of age or older who underwent HSCT from a 1 allele-mismatched URD between 2011 and 2018. The OS rate at Day 180 in the abatacept plus CNI and MTX group was 98% and the OS rate at Day 180 in the CNI and MTX group was 75%.",

    "summary": "Orencia (abatacept) is a medication used to treat several conditions, including polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. UHC's coverage criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, and concomitant medication restrictions. For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, patients must have moderately to severely active disease and meet specific criteria for initial and continuation therapy, including not receiving Orencia in combination with other targeted immunomodulators. For chronic GVHD, patients must have steroid-refractory disease and be receiving Orencia in combination with systemic corticosteroids or be intolerant to systemic corticosteroid therapy. For aGVHD prophylaxis, patients must be at least 2 years old and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor, receiving Orencia in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate. For immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities, patients must have recently received checkpoint inhibitor therapy and have severe or life-threatening immunotherapy-related toxicities. The clinical evidence supporting Orencia's use includes studies demonstrating significant improvements in ACR20 response in psoriatic arthritis, noninferiority of subcutaneous abatacept to intravenous abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis, and sustained improvements in JIA-ACR responses in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. UHC generally limits authorization to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. Orencia is not covered for multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or uveitis associated with Behçet’s disease. The policy was updated on 2025-05-01 to replace references to “biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)” with “targeted immunomodulator” and to update the list of examples of targeted immunomodulators for psoriatic arthritis.",

The benefits were seen regardless of TNF inhibitor exposure, and efficacy was maintained or improved up to week 52. The impact on psoriasis lesions was modest.\n*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** A Phase 3b double-blind study compared subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) abatacept in patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). At month 6, 76.0% of SC abatacept-treated patients versus 75.8% of IV abatacept-treated patients achieved an ACR20 response, confirming noninferiority of SC abatacept to IV abatacept. The Assessing Very Early Rheumatoid arthritis Treatment (AVERT) trial demonstrated that abatacept plus MTX showed efficacy compared with MTX alone in early RA, with a comparable safety profile to MTX.\n*   **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:** A Phase 3, open-label study showed that subcutaneous abatacept in patients with PJIA achieved JIA-ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, or 100 responses or had inactive disease responses at month 4. Improvements were sustained to month 24. The long-term extension (LTE) phase of a pivotal phase III study reported that long-term abatacept therapy, for up to 7 years, was associated with consistent safety, efficacy, and quality of life benefits in patients with JIA.\n*   **Prophylaxis of Acute Graft Versus Host Disease:** In a multicenter clinical study (GVHD-1), abatacept, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and methotrexate (MTX), was evaluated in patients age 6 years and older who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor (URD). The GVHD-2 study analyzed outcomes of abatacept in combination with a CNI and MTX, versus a CNI and MTX alone, for the prophylaxis of aGVHD, in patients 6 years of age or older who underwent HSCT from a 1 allele-mismatched URD between 2011 and 2018.

    "summary": "Orencia (abatacept) is a medication used to treat several conditions, including polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities. UHC's coverage criteria include specific diagnostic requirements, prior treatment history, and concomitant medication restrictions. For polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, patients must have moderately to severely active disease and meet specific criteria for initial and continuation therapy, including not receiving Orencia in combination with other targeted immunomodulators. For chronic GVHD, patients must have steroid-refractory disease and be receiving Orencia in combination with systemic corticosteroids or be intolerant to systemic corticosteroid therapy. For aGVHD prophylaxis, patients must be at least 2 years old and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor, receiving Orencia in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate. For immune checkpoint inhibitor-related toxicities, patients must have recently received checkpoint inhibitor therapy and have severe or life-threatening immunotherapy-related toxicities. The clinical evidence supporting Orencia's use includes studies demonstrating significant improvements in ACR20 response in psoriatic arthritis, noninferiority of subcutaneous abatacept to intravenous abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis, and sustained improvements in JIA-ACR responses in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. UHC generally limits authorization to 12 months, except for aGVHD prophylaxis, which is limited to 4 doses. Orencia is not covered for multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or uveitis associated with Behçet’s disease. The policy was updated on 2025-05-01 to replace references to “biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)” with “targeted immunomodulator” and to update the list of examples of targeted immunomodulators for psoriatic arthritis.",

Patients ranged in age from 4 months to 61 years at first dose. The median duration of exposure was 9.1 months (range 1.9 to 21.7 months).\n\nA phase 1/2 study evaluated lumasiran at multiple doses in a single blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 20 patients with PH1. Patients were randomized 3:1 to receive lumasiran and all patients received lumasiran in the open-label extension phase. After a median of 7 months on lumasiran, patients experienced a 66% mean reduction of urinary oxalate content from baseline. Among patients receiving 3.0 mg/kg monthly or quarterly doses of lumasiran, 10/12 (83%) achieved urinary oxalate levels within the normal range.\n\nILLUMINATE-A was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing lumasiran and placebo in 39 patients ≥ 6 years of age with PH1 and an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (ILLUMINATE-A; NCT03681184). Patients received 3 loading doses of 3 mg/kg lumasiran (n = 26) or placebo (n = 13) administered once monthly, followed by quarterly maintenance doses of 3 mg/kg lumasiran or placebo. The primary endpoint from ILLUMINATE A was the percent reduction from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion corrected for BSA averaged over months 3 through 6. The LS mean percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate in the lumasiran group was -65% (95% CI: -71, -59) compared with -12% (95% CI: -20, -4) in the placebo group, resulting in a between-group LS mean difference of 53% (95% CI: 45, 62; p < 0.0001). By Month 6, 52% (95% CI: 31, 72) of patients treated with lumasiran achieved a normal 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA (≤ 0.514 mmol/24 hr/1.73 m2) compared to 0% (95% CI: 0, 25) placebo-treated patients (p = 0.001).\n\nILLUMINATE-B was a single-arm study in 18 patients < 6 years of age with PH1 and an eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients ≥ 12 months of age or a normal serum creatinine for patients < 12 months of age (ILLUMINATE-B; NCT03905694). The median age was 47 months (range 4 to 74 months). The primary endpoint was the percent reduction from baseline in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio averaged over months 3 through 6. Patients treated with lumasiran achieved a reduction in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio from baseline of 71% (95% CI: 65, 77).\n\nThe approval of lumasiran for the expanded indication to include lowering of plasma oxalate levels was based on ILLUMINATE-C, a single-arm study in 21 patients with PH1, including patients on hemodialysis. Cohort A included 6 patients who did not require dialysis at the time of study enrollment. Cohort B included 15 patients who were on a stable regimen of hemodialysis. The primary endpoint was the percent change in plasma oxalate from baseline to month 6 for Cohort A and the percent change in pre-dialysis plasma oxalate from baseline to month 6 for Cohort B. The percent change from baseline to month 6 in plasma oxalate levels in Cohort A was a least-squares (LS) mean difference of -33% (95% CI: -82, 15) and in Cohort B it was -42% (95% CI: -51, -34).",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "In 2 parallel, phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled treatment trials, Block et al evaluated the effect of the etelcalcetide on serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations in patients receiving hemodialysis. Study participants received etelcalcetide or placebo after each hemodialysis session for 26 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving greater than 30% reduction in mean PTH over baseline during weeks 20-27, while the secondary end point was the proportion of patients reaching a mean PTH of 300 pg/mL or lower. Patients randomized to etelcalcetide were significantly more likely to achieve the primary and secondary endpoints. Regarding adverse events for both trials, patients receiving etelcalcetide had more muscle spasms, as well as nausea and vomiting. The authors conclude that in patients receiving hemodialysis with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism, use of etelcalcetide vs. placebo resulted in greater reduction in serum PTH over 26 weeks.\nBlock GA et al. evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of IV etelcalcetide and oral cinacalcet in patients receiving hemodialysis with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism in a randomized, active control, double-blind phase 3 trial. The trial compared IV etelcalcetide vs. oral placebo and oral cinacalcet with IV placebo in 683 patients receiving hemodialysis with serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations higher than 500 pg/mL on therapy. The patients received either etelcalcetide intravenously with oral placebo or oral cinacalcet with IV placebo for 26 weeks. Administration of the IV formulation was administered 3 times weekly with hemodialysis, while the oral formulation was administered daily. The primary end point was noninferiority of etelcalcetide at achieving more than a 30% reduction in mean predialysis PTH concentrations from baseline during weeks 20-27. Secondary end points included superiority in achieving biochemical end points (> 50% and > 30% reduction in PTH) as well as self-reported nausea or vomiting. Etelcalcetide was noninferior to cinacalcet on the primary end point. The estimated difference in proportions of patients achieving reduction in PTH concentrations of more than 30% between the 198 of 343 patients (57.7%) randomized to receive cinacalcet and the 232 of 340 patients (68.2%) randomized to receive etelcalcetide was -10.5%(95%CI, -17.5% to -3.5%, P for noninferiority, < .001; P for superiority, .004). One hundred seventy-eight patients (52.4%) to randomized etelcalcetide achieved more than 50% reduction in PTH concentrations compared with 138 patients (40.2%) randomized to cinacalcet (P = .001; difference in proportions, 12.2%; 95%CI, 4.7%to 19.5%). The most common adverse effect was decreased blood calcium (68.9%vs 59.8%). The authors conclude that patients with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism receiving hemodialysis, the use of etelcalcetide was not inferior to, and met superiority criteria when compare to cinacalcet. The authors state that additional studies are needed to determine clinical outcomes in addition to efficacy and safety beyond the study period.",

Of the patients who received Reblozyl, 21.4% (n = 48) achieved the primary endpoint compared with 4.5% (n = 5) of those who received placebo (risk difference 17.0; 95% CI 10.4, 23.6; p < 0.0001).\n• Myelodysplastic Syndromes: The efficacy and safety of Reblozyl for the treatment of patients with symptomatic anemia and lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (MEDALIST). Transfusion independence for 8 weeks or longer was observed in 38% of the patients in the luspatercept group, as compared with 13% of those in the placebo group (p < 0.001). A higher percentage of patients in the luspatercept group than in the placebo group met the key secondary end point (28% vs. 8% for weeks 1 through 24, and 33% vs. 12% for weeks 1 through 48; p < 0.001 for both comparisons).\n• The efficacy Reblozyl for the treatment of MDS with associated anemia in erythropoietin-naïve patients was evaluated in the COMMANDS trial, a phase 3, open-label, randomized controlled trial. 86 (59%) of 147 patients in the luspatercept group and 48 (31%) of 154 patients in the epoetin alfa group reached the primary endpoint (common risk difference on response rate 26·6; 95% CI 15·8-37·4; p < 0·0001).",

    "summary": "Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt) is an erythroid maturation agent used to treat anemia in specific patient populations. UHC covers Reblozyl for anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions, symptomatic anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative overlap neoplasm (MDS/MPN), and myelofibrosis-associated anemia, provided specific diagnostic, prior treatment, and specialist consultation criteria are met. For beta thalassemia, patients must be 18 or older, transfusion-dependent, and have required at least six units of packed red blood cells in the prior 24 weeks with no transfusion-free period exceeding 35 days. For MDS, patients must have lower-risk disease, no deletion 5q mutation, and meet ring sideroblast and serum erythropoietin level criteria. For MDS/MPN, patients must have a SF3B1 mutation and thrombocytosis. For myelofibrosis-associated anemia, patients must have symptomatic splenomegaly and/or constitutional symptoms while using a JAK inhibitor, or have no splenomegaly or constitutional symptoms. Initial authorization is for up to 12 months, with continuation requiring documented clinical response. Reblozyl is not covered for alpha thalassemia, beta thalassemia in pediatric patients, non-transfusion dependent beta thalassemia, or sickle beta thalassemia. Clinical trials (BELIEVE, MEDALIST, COMMANDS) have demonstrated Reblozyl's efficacy in reducing transfusion burden and increasing hemoglobin levels in these patient populations. The policy was updated on 2025-09-01 to include NCCN compendium guidance and revise criteria for beta thalassemia and MDS.",

    "summary": "Riabni is a rituximab biosimilar. UHC covers Riabni for FDA-approved indications, including  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA); Relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent; Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy; Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy; and Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Coverage requires a history of intolerance, contraindication, or serious adverse event to either Truxima or Ruxience and physician attestation that the same would not be expected with Riabni. Initial and continuation therapy require prescriber attestation of FDA-approved dosing or published clinical evidence for non-FDA-approved dosing, and documentation of positive clinical response for continuation. In September 2025, the policy was updated to include rituximab for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with specific diagnostic and treatment criteria.",

    "summary": "Riabni is a rituximab biosimilar. UHC covers Riabni for FDA-approved indications, including  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA); Relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent; Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy; Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy; and Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Coverage requires a history of intolerance, contraindication, or serious adverse event to either Truxima or Ruxience and physician attestation that the same would not be expected with Riabni. Initial and continuation therapy require prescriber attestation of FDA-approved dosing or published clinical evidence for non-FDA-approved dosing, and documentation of positive clinical response for continuation. In September 2025, the policy was updated to include rituximab for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with specific diagnostic and treatment criteria.",

    "summary": "Riabni is a rituximab biosimilar. UHC covers Riabni for FDA-approved indications, including  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA); Relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent; Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy; Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy; and Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Coverage requires a history of intolerance, contraindication, or serious adverse event to either Truxima or Ruxience and physician attestation that the same would not be expected with Riabni. Initial and continuation therapy require prescriber attestation of FDA-approved dosing or published clinical evidence for non-FDA-approved dosing, and documentation of positive clinical response for continuation. In September 2025, the policy was updated to include rituximab for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with specific diagnostic and treatment criteria.",

    "summary": "Riabni is a rituximab biosimilar. UHC covers Riabni for FDA-approved indications, including  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA); Relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent; Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy; Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy; and Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Coverage requires a history of intolerance, contraindication, or serious adverse event to either Truxima or Ruxience and physician attestation that the same would not be expected with Riabni. Initial and continuation therapy require prescriber attestation of FDA-approved dosing or published clinical evidence for non-FDA-approved dosing, and documentation of positive clinical response for continuation. In September 2025, the policy was updated to include rituximab for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with specific diagnostic and treatment criteria.",

    "summary": "Riabni is a rituximab biosimilar. UHC covers Riabni for FDA-approved indications, including  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA); Relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent; Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy; Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy; and Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Coverage requires a history of intolerance, contraindication, or serious adverse event to either Truxima or Ruxience and physician attestation that the same would not be expected with Riabni. Initial and continuation therapy require prescriber attestation of FDA-approved dosing or published clinical evidence for non-FDA-approved dosing, and documentation of positive clinical response for continuation. In September 2025, the policy was updated to include rituximab for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with specific diagnostic and treatment criteria.",

    "summary": "Riabni is a rituximab biosimilar. UHC covers Riabni for FDA-approved indications, including  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA); Relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent; Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy; Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy; and Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Coverage requires a history of intolerance, contraindication, or serious adverse event to either Truxima or Ruxience and physician attestation that the same would not be expected with Riabni. Initial and continuation therapy require prescriber attestation of FDA-approved dosing or published clinical evidence for non-FDA-approved dosing, and documentation of positive clinical response for continuation. In September 2025, the policy was updated to include rituximab for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with specific diagnostic and treatment criteria.",

    "summary": "Riabni is a rituximab biosimilar. UHC covers Riabni for FDA-approved indications, including  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA); Relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent; Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy; Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy; and Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Coverage requires a history of intolerance, contraindication, or serious adverse event to either Truxima or Ruxience and physician attestation that the same would not be expected with Riabni. Initial and continuation therapy require prescriber attestation of FDA-approved dosing or published clinical evidence for non-FDA-approved dosing, and documentation of positive clinical response for continuation. In September 2025, the policy was updated to include rituximab for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with specific diagnostic and treatment criteria.",

    "summary": "Riabni is a rituximab biosimilar. UHC covers Riabni for FDA-approved indications, including  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA); Relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent; Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy; Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy; and Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Coverage requires a history of intolerance, contraindication, or serious adverse event to either Truxima or Ruxience and physician attestation that the same would not be expected with Riabni. Initial and continuation therapy require prescriber attestation of FDA-approved dosing or published clinical evidence for non-FDA-approved dosing, and documentation of positive clinical response for continuation. In September 2025, the policy was updated to include rituximab for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with specific diagnostic and treatment criteria.",

    "summary": "Riabni is a rituximab biosimilar. UHC covers Riabni for FDA-approved indications, including  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA); Relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent; Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy; Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy; and Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Coverage requires a history of intolerance, contraindication, or serious adverse event to either Truxima or Ruxience and physician attestation that the same would not be expected with Riabni. Initial and continuation therapy require prescriber attestation of FDA-approved dosing or published clinical evidence for non-FDA-approved dosing, and documentation of positive clinical response for continuation. In September 2025, the policy was updated to include rituximab for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with specific diagnostic and treatment criteria.",

    "summary": "Riabni is a rituximab biosimilar. UHC covers Riabni for FDA-approved indications, including  Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA); Relapsed or refractory, low-grade, or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent; Previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy; Non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy; and Previously untreated diffuse large B-cell, CD20-positive NHL in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Coverage requires a history of intolerance, contraindication, or serious adverse event to either Truxima or Ruxience and physician attestation that the same would not be expected with Riabni. Initial and continuation therapy require prescriber attestation of FDA-approved dosing or published clinical evidence for non-FDA-approved dosing, and documentation of positive clinical response for continuation. In September 2025, the policy was updated to include rituximab for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) with specific diagnostic and treatment criteria.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "A phase 1/2 dose-escalation study evaluated valoctocogene roxaparvovec in nine men with severe hemophilia A.3,4 One patient was in the low-dose cohort (Cohort 1: 6 x 1012 vector genomes per kilogram of body weight [vg/kg]), one patient was in the intermediate-dose cohort (Cohort 2: 2 x 1013 vg/kg), and seven were in the high-dose cohort (Cohort 3: 6 x 1013 vg/kg). An additional fourth cohort of 6 patients was later added who received a dose of 4 x 1013 vg/kg. Eligible participants were adults with severe hemophilia A, with no history of factor VIII inhibitor development and without detectable immunity to the AAV5 capsid. Patients were considered to have severe hemophilia A if their factor VIII (FVIII) levels had ever declined to 1 IU/dL or less. Patients were required to have at least 150 days of previous exposure to factor VIII concentrate or cryoprecipitate. For participants using on-demand factor VIII therapy, rather than continuous prophylaxis, the criterion for inclusion was at least 12 bleeding episodes in the 12 months before study entry.\nPatients were excluded from the study if they had detectable antibodies to AAV5, detectable HIV viral load, evidence of significant liver dysfunction as defined by abnormal elevation greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal for ALT (alanine transaminase), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or an INR (international normalized ratio) greater than 1.4, or liver cirrhosis. Potential participants who had a liver biopsy in the past 3 years were excluded if they had significant fibrosis of 3 or 4 as rated on a scale of 0-4. Additional exclusion criteria included a platelet count of less than 100,000/dL, serum creatinine of greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL, positive hepatitis B surface antigen, detectable hepatitis C viral load, or evidence of any active infection or immunosuppressive disorder.\nIn the high-dose cohort (6 x 1013 vg/kg), the factor VIII activity level was more than 5 IU/dL between weeks 2 and 9 after gene transfer in all seven participants, and the level in six participants increased to a normal value (> 50 IU/dL) that was maintained at 1 year after receipt of the dose. In the high-dose cohort, the median annualized bleeding rate among participants who had previously received prophylactic therapy decreased from 16 events before the study to 1 event after gene transfer, and factor VIII use for participant-reported bleeding ceased in all the participants in this cohort by week 22. The median annualized use of factor VIII fell from 138 infusions per year before the study to 2 infusions per year after gene transfer (mean reduction in rate, from 137 to 5 infusions per year) and was 0 after week 2. The median consumption of factor VIII decreased from 5286 to 65 IU/kg per year.\nIn the three year follow up to the phase 1/2 study for cohorts 1, 2, and 3, two participants (one who had received 6×1012 vg/kg and one who had received 2×1013 vg/kg) had factor VIII expression of less than 1 IU/dL.5 Seven participants who had received 6×1013 vg/kg (cohort 3) had a median factor VIII expression of 20 IU/dL. The mean factor VIII expression measured by chromogenic assay at the ends of years 1, 2, and 3 were 64 IU/dL (median, 60 IU/dL), 36 IU/dL (median, 26 IU/dL), and 33 IU/dL (median, 20 IU/dL), respectively. The mean annualized rate of bleeding events decreased by 96%, from a mean (±SD) of 16.3 ±15.7 events per year (median, 16.5 events per year) at baseline to 0.7 ±1.6 events per year (median, 0.0 events per year) at the end of year 3. At the end of study year 3, a total of six participants (86%) were free from bleeding events. In the year before study entry, the mean annualized number of factor VIII infusions per participant was 136.7 ±22.4 (median, 138.5); at the end of year 3, the mean annualized use of exogenous factor VIII decreased by 96% to a mean of 5.5 ±9.4 infusions (median, 0.0 infusions).\nIn the four-year follow-up, the six patients with data available from cohort 3 had a median factor VIII expression of 16.4 IU/dL. The mean factor VIII expression measured by chromogenic assay at the ends of years 1, 2, 3, and 4 continued to decline and were 64 IU/dL(median, 60 IU/dL), 36 IU/dL (median, 26 IU/dL), 33 IU/dL (median, 20 IU/dL), and 24 IU/dL (median 16.4 IU/dL) respectively. The mean annualized rate of bleeding events decreased by 96%, from a mean of 16.3 events per year (median, 16.5 events per year) at baseline to 0.8 events per year (median, 0.0 events per year) at the end of year 4. In the fourth year the mean ABR was 1.3 with a median ABR of 0. At the end of study year 4, a total of six of the seven participants (86%) were free from bleeding events and no participants were requiring prophylactic therapy. In the year before study entry, the mean annualized number of factor VIII infusions per participant was 135.6 (median, 136.5); at the end of year 4, the mean annualized use of exogenous factor VIII decreased by 96% to a mean of 5.4 infusions.12\nTwo years after infusion, six participants in cohort 4 who had received 4×1013 vg per kilogram had a mean factor VIII activity level of 21.0 IU/dL (median, 23 IU/dL) at the end of year 1 and 15 IU/dL (median, 13 IU/dL) at the end of year 2. The annualized rate of bleeding events decreased by 92%, from a mean of 12.2 ±15.4 events per year (median, 8.0 events per year) in the year before study entry to a mean of 1.2 ±2.4 events per year (median, 0.0 events per year) at the end of year 2. In the year before study entry, the mean annualized number of factor VIII infusions per participant was 146.5 ±41.6 (median, 155.5). At end of year 2, the mean annual use of exogenous factor VIII decreased by 95%, to a mean of 6.8 ±15.6 infusions (median, 0.5 infusions) and the median use of factor VIII was reduced from 155.5 infusions to 0.5 infusions per year.\nIn the three-year follow-up of the six participants in cohort 4 who had received 4×1013 vg per kilogram had a median factor VIII activity level of 7.9 IU/dL. The mean factor VIII expression measured by chromogenic assay at the ends of years 1, 2, and 3 continued to decline and were 21 IU/dL (median, 23 IU/dL), 15 IU/dL (median, 13 IU/dL), and 9.9 IU/dL (median 7.9 IU/dL) respectively. The mean annualized rate of bleeding events decreased by 93%, from a mean of 12.2 events per year (median, 8.0 events per year) in the year before study entry to a mean of 0.9 events per year at the end of year 3. In the year before study entry, the mean annualized number of factor VIII infusions per participant was 142.8 (median, 155.8). At end of year 3, the mean annual use of exogenous factor VIII decreased by 96%, to a mean of 5.7 annual infusions over the 3 years. In year 3, the mean annual infusion rate was 8.4 (median 1.5). At the end of study year 3, four of the six participants (67%) remained free from bleeding events, with five of the six, free of target joint bleeds. No participants required prophylactic therapy.12\nThe efficacy of valoctocogene roxaparvovec was evaluated in a prospective, phase 3, open-label, single-dose, single-arm, multinational study in 134 adult males (18 years of age and older) with severe hemophilia A, who received a single intravenous dose of 6 × 1013 vg/kg body weight of valoctocogene roxaparvovec and entered a follow-up period of 5 years. Patients previously treated with prophylactic factor VIII replacement therapy, but not emicizumab, were enrolled in the study. The study population was 72% White, 14% Asian, and 11% Black with a median age of 30 (range: 18 to 70) years. Twenty patients had a history of hepatitis B and 41 patients had a history of hepatitis C. All except 2 patients were HIV-negative. Only patients without detectable, pre-existing antibodies to AAV5 capsid were eligible for therapy. Presence of pre-existing antibodies to AAV5 capsid was identified during screening using the ARUP Laboratories AAV5 DetectCDx™ total antibody assay, which is the FDA-approved test for selection of patients for valoctocogene roxaparvovec therapy. Other key exclusion criteria included active infection, chronic or active hepatitis B or C, immunosuppressive disorder including HIV, current or prior history of factor VIII inhibitor, stage 3 or 4 liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver function test abnormalities, history of thrombosis or thrombophilia, serum creatinine ≥ 1.4 mg/dL, and active malignancy. Of the 134 patients who received valoctocogene roxaparvovec in the clinical trial, 112 patients had baseline annualized bleeding rate (ABR) data prospectively collected during a period of at least six months on factor VIII prophylaxis prior to receiving valoctocogene roxaparvovec (rollover population). The remaining 22 patients had baseline ABR collected retrospectively (directly enrolled population). All patients were followed for at least 3 years. The primary efficacy outcome was a non-inferiority (NI) test of the difference in ABR in the efficacy evaluation period (EEP) following ROCTAVIAN administration compared with ABR during the baseline period in the rollover population. The NI margin was 3.5 bleeds per year. All bleeding episodes, regardless of treatment, were counted towards ABR. The EEP started from Study Day 33 (Week 5) or the end of factor VIII prophylaxis including a washout period after valoctocogene roxaparvovec treatment, whichever was later, and ended when a patient completed the study, had the last visit, or withdrew or was lost to follow-up from the study, whichever was the earliest. The mean EEP ABR was 2.6 bleeds/year, compared to a mean baseline ABR of 5.4 bleeds/year. The mean difference in ABR was -2.8 (95% confidence interval: -4.3, -1.2) bleeds/year. The NI analysis met the pre-specified NI margin, indicating the effectiveness of valoctocogene roxaparvovec. A majority of patients treated with valoctocogene roxaparvovec received immunosuppressive medications, including steroids, to control elevations in transaminases and to prevent loss of transgene expression. In the rollover population, a total of 5 patients (4%) did not respond and 17 patients (15%) lost response to valoctocogene roxaparvovec treatment over a median time of 2.3 (range: 1.0 to 3.3) years. In the directly enrolled population with a longer follow-up, a total of 1 patient (5%) did not respond and 6 patients (27%) lost response to valoctocogene roxaparvovec treatment over a median time of 3.6 (range: 1.2 to 4.3) years.",

The study included a 4-week screening period and a 6-week treatment period followed by 8 weeks of observation. During the treatment period, rozanolixizumab-noli or placebo were administered subcutaneously once a week for six weeks.\n\nStudy 1 enrolled patients who met the following criteria:\nPresence of autoantibodies against AChR or MuSK\nMyasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Clinical Classification Class II to IVa\nMyasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score of at least 3 (with at least 3 points from non-ocular symptoms)\nOn stable dose of MG therapy prior to screening that included acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, steroids, or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (NSISTs), either in combination or alone\nSerum IgG levels of at least 5.5 g/L\nIn Study 1, a total of 200 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive weight-tiered doses of rozanolixizumab-noli (n = 133), equivalent to = 7 mg/kg (n = 66) or ≈10 mg/kg (n = 67), or placebo (n = 67). Patients had a median age of 52 years at baseline (range: 18 to 89 years) and a median time since diagnosis of 6 years. Sixty-one percent of patients were female, 68% were White, 11% were Asian, 3% were Black or African American, 1% were American Indian or Alaska Native, and 7% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Median MG-ADL total score was 8, and the median Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score was 15. The majority of patients, 89.5% (n = 179) were positive for AChR antibodies and 10.5% (n = 21) were positive for MuSK antibodies. At baseline in each group, over 83% of patients received AChE inhibitors, over 56% of patients received steroids, and approximately 50% received NSISTs, at stable doses. Patients were treated with RYSTIGGO via subcutaneous infusion once per week for a period of 6 weeks, followed by an observation period of up to 8 weeks. The efficacy of rozanolixizumab-noli was measured using the MG-ADL scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the MG-ADL total score at day 43. A statistically significant difference favoring rozanolixizumab-noli was observed in the MG-ADL total score change from baseline [-3.4 points in rozanolixizumab-noli -treated group at either dose vs -0.8 points in the placebo-treated group (p < 0.001)]. Reductions from baseline to day 43 in MG-ADL scores were observed in patients with AChR autoantibodypositive generalized myasthenia gravis [rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg least-squares mean –3·03 (SE 0·89); rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg –3·36 (0·87); placebo –1·10 (0·87); least-squares mean difference from placebo −1·94 (97·5% CI −3·06 to −0·81) and −2·26 (−3·39 to −1·13) in the rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups, respectively].

UHC covers Rystiggo for gMG when specific criteria are met, including confirmation of gMG diagnosis, positive serologic tests for anti-AChR or anti-MuSK antibodies, MGFA Clinical Classification of class II, III, or IV, and MG-ADL total score ≥ 5. Patients must have a history of failure of at least two immunosuppressive agents (if AChR antibody positive) or at least one immunosuppressive agent (if MuSK antibody positive) over at least 12 months, or a history of failure of at least one immunosuppressive therapy and have required four or more courses of plasmapheresis/plasma exchanges and/or immune globulin over at least 12 months without symptom control. The patient must not be receiving Rystiggo in combination with a complement inhibitor, another FcRn blocker, or an immune globulin. Initial authorization is for no more than 12 months. Continuation of therapy requires previous treatment with Rystiggo, improvement in MG-ADL score, reduction in signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis, and maintenance, reduction, or discontinuation of dose(s) of baseline immunosuppressive therapy. Clinical evidence supporting Rystiggo's efficacy comes from a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT03971422) that demonstrated a statistically significant difference favoring rozanolixizumab-noli in the MG-ADL total score change from baseline.

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Furie et al evaluated the efficacy and safety of anifrolumab, a type I interferon (IFN) receptor antagonist, in a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adults with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients (n = 305) were randomized to receive intravenous anifrolumab (300 mg or 1,000 mg) or placebo, in addition to standard therapy, every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Randomization was stratified by SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 score (< 10 or ≥ 10), oral corticosteroid dosage (< 10 or ≥ 10 mg/day), and type I IFN gene signature test status (high or low) based on a 4-gene expression assay. The primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving an SLE Responder Index (SRI[4]) response at week 24 with sustained reduction of oral corticosteroids (< 10 mg/day and less than or equal to the dose at week 1 from week 12 through 24). Other end points (including SRI[4], British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG]-based Composite Lupus Assessment [BICLA], modified SRI[6], and major clinical response) were assessed at week 52. The primary end point was analyzed in the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population and type I IFN-high subpopulation. The study result was considered positive if the primary end point was met in either of the 2 study populations. The Type I error rate was controlled at 0.10 (2-sided), within each of the 2 study populations for the primary end point analysis. The primary end point was met by more patients treated with anifrolumab (34.3% of 99 for 300 mg and 28.8% of 104 for 1,000 mg) than placebo (17.6% of 102) (p = 0.014 for 300 mg and p = 0.063 for 1,000 mg, versus placebo), with greater effect size in patients with a high IFN signature at baseline (13.2% in placebo-treated patients versus 36.0% [p = 0.004] and 28.2% [p = 0.029]) in patients treated with anifrolumab 300 mg and 1,000 mg, respectively.\nAt week 52, patients treated with anifrolumab achieved greater responses in SRI(4) (40.2% versus 62.6% [p < 0.001] and 53.8% [p = 0.043] with placebo, anifrolumab 300 mg, and anifrolumab 1,000 mg, respectively), BICLA (25.7% versus 53.5% [p < 0.001] and 41.2% [p = 0.018], respectively), modified SRI(6) (28.4% versus 49.5% [p = 0.002] and 44.7% [p = 0.015], respectively), major clinical response (BILAG 2004 C or better in all organ domains from week 24 through week 52) (6.9% versus 19.2% [p = 0.012] and 17.3% [p = 0.025], respectively), and several other global and organ-specific end points. Herpes zoster was more frequent in the anifrolumab-treated patients (2.0% with placebo treatment versus 5.1% and 9.5% with anifrolumab 300 mg and 1,000 mg, respectively), as were cases reported as influenza (2.0% versus 6.1% and 7.6%, respectively), in the anifrolumab treatment groups. Incidence of serious adverse events was similar between groups (18.8% versus 16.2% and 17.1%, respectively). Researchers concluded that anifrolumab substantially reduced disease activity compared with placebo across multiple clinical end points in the patients with moderate-to-severe SLE.\nPooled data from the phase 3 TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials in patients with moderate to severe SLE were analyzed by Furie et al to determine anifrolumab's effect on flares, including those arising with glucocorticoid taper. TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 were randomized, placebo-controlled, 52-week trials of intravenous anifrolumab (300 mg every 4 weeks for 48 weeks). For patients receiving baseline glucocorticoid ≥ 10 mg/day, attempted taper to ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent from Weeks 8-40 was required and defined as sustained reduction when maintained through Week 52. Flares were defined as ≥ 1 new BILAG-2004 A or ≥ 2 new BILAG-2004 B scores versus the previous visit. Flare assessments were compared for patients receiving anifrolumab versus placebo. Compared with placebo (n = 366), anifrolumab (n = 360) was associated with lower annualized flare rates (rate ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60-0.95), prolonged time to first flare (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.89), and fewer patients with ≥ 1 flare (difference -9.3%, 95% CI -16.3 to -2.3), as well as flares in organ domains commonly active at baseline (musculoskeletal, mucocutaneous). Fewer BILAG-based Composite Lupus Assessment responders had ≥ 1 flare with anifrolumab (21.1%, 36/171) versus placebo (30.4%, 34/112). Of patients who achieved sustained glucocorticoid reductions from ≥ 10 mg/day at baseline, more remained flare free with anifrolumab (40.0%, 76/190) versus placebo (17.3%, 32/185). The authors concluded that analyses of pooled TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 data support that anifrolumab reduces flares while permitting glucocorticoid taper in patients with SLE.\nMorand et al randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous anifrolumab (300 mg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. The primary end point of this trial was a response at week 52 defined with the use of the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA). A BICLA response requires reduction in any moderate-to-severe baseline disease activity and no worsening in any of nine organ systems in the BILAG index, no worsening on the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index, no increase of 0.3 points or more in the score on the Physician Global Assessment of disease activity (on a scale from 0 [no disease activity] to 3 [severe disease]), no discontinuation of the trial intervention, and no use of medications restricted by the protocol. Secondary end points included a BICLA response in patients with a high interferon gene signature at baseline; reductions in the glucocorticoid dose, in the severity of skin disease, and in counts of swollen and tender joints; and the annualized flare rate. A total of 362 patients received the randomized intervention: 180 received anifrolumab and 182 received placebo. The percentage of patients who had a BICLA response was 47.8% in the anifrolumab group and 31.5% in the placebo group (difference, 16.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 6.3 to 26.3; p = 0.001). Among patients with a high interferon gene signature, the percentage with a response was 48.0% in the anifrolumab group and 30.7% in the placebo group; among patients with a low interferon gene signature, the percentage was 46.7% and 35.5%, respectively. Secondary end points with respect to the glucocorticoid dose and the severity of skin disease but not counts of swollen and tender joints and the annualized flare rate, also showed a significant benefit with anifrolumab. Herpes zoster and bronchitis occurred in 7.2% and 12.2% of the patients, respectively, who received anifrolumab. There was one death from pneumonia in the anifrolumab group. Researchers concluded that administration of anifrolumab resulted in a higher percentage of patients with a response (as defined by a composite end point) at week 52 than did placebo, in contrast to the findings of a similar phase 3 trial involving patients with SLE that had a different primary end point. The frequency of herpes zoster was higher with anifrolumab than with placebo.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials assessed the efficacy of subcutaneous implants containing 16 mg of afamelanotide. Patients in the European Union (74 patients) and the United States (94 patients) were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive a subcutaneous implant containing either afamelanotide or placebo every 60 days (a total of five implants in the European Union study and three in the U.S study).\nIn the European Union study, 38 received 16 mg of afamelanotide administered subcutaneously every 2 months, 36 received vehicle. Subjects received five implants and were followed for 270 days. On each study day, subjects recorded the number of hours spent outdoors between 10 am and 3 pm, whether “most of the day” was spent in direct sunlight, shade, or a combination of both, and whether they experienced any phototoxic pain that day. The primary endpoint was the total number of hours over 270 days spent outdoors between 10 am and 3 pm on days with no pain for which “most of the day” was spent in direct sunlight. The median total number of hours over 270 days spent outdoors between 10 am and 3 pm on days with no pain for which “most of the day” was spent in direct sunlight was 6.0 hours for subjects in the afamelanotide group and 0.75 hours for subjects in the vehicle group.\nIn the U.S. study, 48 received 16 mg of afamelanotide administered subcutaneously every 2 months, 45 received vehicle. Subjects received three implants and were followed for 180 days. On each study day, subjects recorded the number of hours spent in direct sunlight between 10 am and 6 pm, the number of hours spent in shade between 10 am and 6 pm, and whether they experienced any phototoxic pain that day. The primary endpoint was the total number of hours over 180 days spent in direct sunlight between 10 am and 6 pm on days with no pain. The median total number of hours over 180 days spent in direct sunlight between 10 am and 6 pm on days with no pain was 64.1 hours for subjects receiving afamelanotide and 40.5 hours for subjects receiving vehicle.",

    "summary": "Scenesse (afamelanotide) is indicated to increase pain free light exposure in adult patients with a history of phototoxic reactions from erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). Initial therapy requires submission of medical records supporting the diagnosis of EPP, confirming increased erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels or specific genetic abnormalities. Patients must be 18 years or older with a history of phototoxic reactions. The prescription must be by or in consultation with a hematologist or specialist in EPP management. Scenesse is administered subcutaneously by a trained healthcare professional, with dosing per FDA labeling. Initial authorization is for up to 12 months. Continuation requires previous Scenesse use, positive clinical response, and adherence to specialist prescription and administration protocols, with reauthorization for up to 12 months. Clinical evidence includes two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials assessing afamelanotide's efficacy in increasing pain-free light exposure. The European Union study showed a median of 6.0 hours of pain-free sunlight exposure for afamelanotide versus 0.75 hours for vehicle. The U.S. study showed 64.1 hours for afamelanotide versus 40.5 hours for vehicle. Policy revisions include formatting corrections and updated benefit considerations.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "•\tAnkylosing Spondylitis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 208 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and inadequate response or intolerance to NSAIDs. Patients had a diagnosis of definite AS for at least 3 months according to modified New York criteria. Patients had symptoms of active disease [Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥ 4, VAS for total back pain of ≥ 4, on scales of 0 to 10 cm (0 to 100 mm), and a hsCRP level of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (3 mg/L)]. Patients were randomized to receive either golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 105) or placebo (n = 103) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 16, Week 20, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 20 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of concomitant methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day), and/or NSAIDs during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited.\n\t•\tThe primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 20 response at Week 16. In this trial, golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ASAS 20 response at Week 16, where a greater percentage of patients treated with golimumab achieved a low level of disease activity (< 2 [on a scale of 0 to 10 cm] in all four ASAS domains) compared with patients treated with placebo (16.2% vs. 3.9%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary and mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36. Golimumab-treated patients showed significant improvement compared with placebo-treated patients in health related quality of life as assessed by the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life questionnaire (ASQoL).\n•\tPsoriatic Arthritis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 480 adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) despite NSAID or DMARD therapy. Previous treatment with a biologic was not allowed. Patients in this trial had a diagnosis of PsA for at least six months and had symptoms of active disease [≥ 5 swollen joints and ≥ 5 tender joints and a CRP level of ≥ 0.6 mg/dL]. Patients were randomized to either receive golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 241) or placebo (n = 239) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 24, Week 28, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 28 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of MTX, NSAIDs, and low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day) during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Patients with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with absence of rheumatoid nodules (44%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (19%), distal interphalangeal joint involvement (8.1%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (25%), and arthritis mutilans (4.8%). During the trial, concomitant medications used included MTX (70%), oral corticosteroids (28%), and NSAIDs (71%). Golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Similar ACR 20 responses at Week 24 were observed in patients with different PsA subtypes. ACR 20 responses observed in the golimumab-treated groups were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX. Patients with enthesitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) on a scale of 0-6. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement in enthesitis, with a mean reduction of 1.8 as compared with a mean reduction in placebo-treated patients of 0.8 at Week 14. Patients with dactylitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement on a scale of 0-60. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement, with a mean reduction of 7.8 compared with a mean reduction of 2.8 in placebo-treated patients at Week 14. Golimumab inhibited the progression of structural damage compared with placebo, as assessed by total modified vdH-S score. At Week 24, a greater proportion of patients in the golimumab group (72%) had no progression of structural damage (change in the total modified vdH-S score ≤ 0), compared to 43% of patients in the placebo group. Improvement in physical function as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) demonstrated that the proportion of patients who achieved clinically meaningful improvement of ≥ 0.3 in HAQ-DI score from baseline was greater in the golimumab-treated group compared to placebo at Week 14 (69% compared to 32%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary, mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36.\n•\tRheumatoid Arthritis\n\t•\tIn the extension phase to the GO-FURTHER pivotal study, the long-term extension study of golimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis evaluated the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and radiographic progression, through 100 weeks of therapy, where safety was monitored through 112 weeks. In the original trial 592 patients with active RA were randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous (IV) golimumab 2mg/kg plus MTX or placebo plus MTX at weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients receiving placebo were able to cross over at either week 16 or week 24 to active therapy. In total, 486 patients (82.1%) continued golimumab therapy for 100 weeks. Efficacy assessments included the American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, 70% (ACR 20, ACR50, ACR70) response criteria, 28 joint count disease activity score using the C-reactive protein level, physical function, and quality of life (QoL) measures, and changes in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde scores (SHS). Following treatment at week 100, in both groups combined, 68.1% of patients had an ACR20 response, 43.8% had an ACR50, and 23.5% had an ACR70 response. More than 80% of all patients had a good or moderate DAS28-CRP response at week 100, and approximately 28% achieved DAS28-CRP < 2.6. For patient reported outcomes, improvements in SF-36 PCS, MCS, FACIT-Fatigue, EQ-5D VAS scores were sustained through week 112 in both treatment groups. At week 100, the mean change from baseline in total SHS score was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (0.74 vs. 2.10; p = 0.005) and 61.8% (n = 244 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 54.8% (n = 108 of 197) of patients in Group 2 had a change from baseline in total SHS of ≤ 0. When evaluated by progression beyond the smallest detectable change (3.22) in total SHS, 16.7% (n = 66 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 23.9% (n = 47 of 197) in Group 2 demonstrated radiographic progression from baseline to week 100. The mean change in total SHS score from week 52 to week 100 when all patients were receiving golimumab was numerically lower in Group 1 (0.56) than in Group 2 (0.80); the median change was 0 in both groups. After 112 weeks, a total of 481 patients completed the safety follow-up with 79.1% had at least one adverse event, and 18.2% having had a serious adverse event. After 100 weeks of treatment only 6.7% (n = 37 of 553) of patients developed antibodies to golimumab, with 86.5% positive for neutralizing antibodies. The authors concluded that treatment with IV golimumab plus MTX afforded a clinical response that was maintained through week 100. Radiographic progression following treatment was clinically insignificant between week 52 and week 100.\n•\tPolyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA)\n\t•\tThe efficacy of golimumab in pediatric patients with pJIA is based on the pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of golimumab in RA patients. Efficacy of golimumab was also assessed in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in 127 children (2 to < 18 years of age) with JIA with active polyarthritis despite treatment with MTX for at least 2 months (Trial pJIA, NCT02277444). The polyarticular JIA patient subtypes at study entry included: rheumatoid factor negative (43%), rheumatoid factor positive (35%), enthesitis-related arthritis (9%), oligoarticular extended (6%), juvenile psoriatic arthritis (4%), and systemic JIA without systemic manifestations (3%). All patients received golimumab 80 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, 4, and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients continued stable doses of MTX weekly through Week 28; after Week 28, changes in MTX dose were permitted. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 52. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in patients with RA.",

    "summary": "Simponi Aria (golimumab) is a TNF blocker indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA in combination with methotrexate (MTX), active PsA in patients 2 years of age or older, active AS, and active pJIA in patients 2 years of age and older. For ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Simponi Aria is approved for initial therapy and continuation of therapy when specific criteria are met, including diagnosis of the respective condition, initiation and titration according to FDA labeled dosing, and not receiving Simponi Aria in combination with a targeted immunomodulator. For medical necessity, specific criteria must be met, including history of failure to previous treatments or being currently on Simponi Aria, and prescription by or in consultation with a specialist. Initial and reauthorizations are for no more than 12 months. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of golimumab in treating these conditions, with significant improvements in signs and symptoms compared to placebo. The policy was updated on 03/01/2025 to reflect current information and archived the previous version.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "•\tAnkylosing Spondylitis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 208 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and inadequate response or intolerance to NSAIDs. Patients had a diagnosis of definite AS for at least 3 months according to modified New York criteria. Patients had symptoms of active disease [Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥ 4, VAS for total back pain of ≥ 4, on scales of 0 to 10 cm (0 to 100 mm), and a hsCRP level of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (3 mg/L)]. Patients were randomized to receive either golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 105) or placebo (n = 103) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 16, Week 20, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 20 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of concomitant methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day), and/or NSAIDs during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited.\n\t•\tThe primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 20 response at Week 16. In this trial, golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ASAS 20 response at Week 16, where a greater percentage of patients treated with golimumab achieved a low level of disease activity (< 2 [on a scale of 0 to 10 cm] in all four ASAS domains) compared with patients treated with placebo (16.2% vs. 3.9%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary and mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36. Golimumab-treated patients showed significant improvement compared with placebo-treated patients in health related quality of life as assessed by the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life questionnaire (ASQoL).\n•\tPsoriatic Arthritis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 480 adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) despite NSAID or DMARD therapy. Previous treatment with a biologic was not allowed. Patients in this trial had a diagnosis of PsA for at least six months and had symptoms of active disease [≥ 5 swollen joints and ≥ 5 tender joints and a CRP level of ≥ 0.6 mg/dL]. Patients were randomized to either receive golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 241) or placebo (n = 239) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 24, Week 28, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 28 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of MTX, NSAIDs, and low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day) during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Patients with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with absence of rheumatoid nodules (44%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (19%), distal interphalangeal joint involvement (8.1%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (25%), and arthritis mutilans (4.8%). During the trial, concomitant medications used included MTX (70%), oral corticosteroids (28%), and NSAIDs (71%). Golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Similar ACR 20 responses at Week 24 were observed in patients with different PsA subtypes. ACR 20 responses observed in the golimumab-treated groups were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX. Patients with enthesitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) on a scale of 0-6. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement in enthesitis, with a mean reduction of 1.8 as compared with a mean reduction in placebo-treated patients of 0.8 at Week 14. Patients with dactylitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement on a scale of 0-60. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement, with a mean reduction of 7.8 compared with a mean reduction of 2.8 in placebo-treated patients at Week 14. Golimumab inhibited the progression of structural damage compared with placebo, as assessed by total modified vdH-S score. At Week 24, a greater proportion of patients in the golimumab group (72%) had no progression of structural damage (change in the total modified vdH-S score ≤ 0), compared to 43% of patients in the placebo group. Improvement in physical function as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) demonstrated that the proportion of patients who achieved clinically meaningful improvement of ≥ 0.3 in HAQ-DI score from baseline was greater in the golimumab-treated group compared to placebo at Week 14 (69% compared to 32%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary, mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36.\n•\tRheumatoid Arthritis\n\t•\tIn the extension phase to the GO-FURTHER pivotal study, the long-term extension study of golimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis evaluated the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and radiographic progression, through 100 weeks of therapy, where safety was monitored through 112 weeks. In the original trial 592 patients with active RA were randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous (IV) golimumab 2mg/kg plus MTX or placebo plus MTX at weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients receiving placebo were able to cross over at either week 16 or week 24 to active therapy. In total, 486 patients (82.1%) continued golimumab therapy for 100 weeks. Efficacy assessments included the American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, 70% (ACR 20, ACR50, ACR70) response criteria, 28 joint count disease activity score using the C-reactive protein level, physical function, and quality of life (QoL) measures, and changes in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde scores (SHS). Following treatment at week 100, in both groups combined, 68.1% of patients had an ACR20 response, 43.8% had an ACR50, and 23.5% had an ACR70 response. More than 80% of all patients had a good or moderate DAS28-CRP response at week 100, and approximately 28% achieved DAS28-CRP < 2.6. For patient reported outcomes, improvements in SF-36 PCS, MCS, FACIT-Fatigue, EQ-5D VAS scores were sustained through week 112 in both treatment groups. At week 100, the mean change from baseline in total SHS score was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (0.74 vs. 2.10; p = 0.005) and 61.8% (n = 244 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 54.8% (n = 108 of 197) of patients in Group 2 had a change from baseline in total SHS of ≤ 0. When evaluated by progression beyond the smallest detectable change (3.22) in total SHS, 16.7% (n = 66 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 23.9% (n = 47 of 197) in Group 2 demonstrated radiographic progression from baseline to week 100. The mean change in total SHS score from week 52 to week 100 when all patients were receiving golimumab was numerically lower in Group 1 (0.56) than in Group 2 (0.80); the median change was 0 in both groups. After 112 weeks, a total of 481 patients completed the safety follow-up with 79.1% had at least one adverse event, and 18.2% having had a serious adverse event. After 100 weeks of treatment only 6.7% (n = 37 of 553) of patients developed antibodies to golimumab, with 86.5% positive for neutralizing antibodies. The authors concluded that treatment with IV golimumab plus MTX afforded a clinical response that was maintained through week 100. Radiographic progression following treatment was clinically insignificant between week 52 and week 100.\n•\tPolyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA)\n\t•\tThe efficacy of golimumab in pediatric patients with pJIA is based on the pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of golimumab in RA patients. Efficacy of golimumab was also assessed in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in 127 children (2 to < 18 years of age) with JIA with active polyarthritis despite treatment with MTX for at least 2 months (Trial pJIA, NCT02277444). The polyarticular JIA patient subtypes at study entry included: rheumatoid factor negative (43%), rheumatoid factor positive (35%), enthesitis-related arthritis (9%), oligoarticular extended (6%), juvenile psoriatic arthritis (4%), and systemic JIA without systemic manifestations (3%). All patients received golimumab 80 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, 4, and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients continued stable doses of MTX weekly through Week 28; after Week 28, changes in MTX dose were permitted. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 52. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in patients with RA.",

    "summary": "Simponi Aria (golimumab) is a TNF blocker indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA in combination with methotrexate (MTX), active PsA in patients 2 years of age or older, active AS, and active pJIA in patients 2 years of age and older. For ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Simponi Aria is approved for initial therapy and continuation of therapy when specific criteria are met, including diagnosis of the respective condition, initiation and titration according to FDA labeled dosing, and not receiving Simponi Aria in combination with a targeted immunomodulator. For medical necessity, specific criteria must be met, including history of failure to previous treatments or being currently on Simponi Aria, and prescription by or in consultation with a specialist. Initial and reauthorizations are for no more than 12 months. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of golimumab in treating these conditions, with significant improvements in signs and symptoms compared to placebo. The policy was updated on 03/01/2025 to reflect current information and archived the previous version.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "•\tAnkylosing Spondylitis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 208 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and inadequate response or intolerance to NSAIDs. Patients had a diagnosis of definite AS for at least 3 months according to modified New York criteria. Patients had symptoms of active disease [Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥ 4, VAS for total back pain of ≥ 4, on scales of 0 to 10 cm (0 to 100 mm), and a hsCRP level of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (3 mg/L)]. Patients were randomized to receive either golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 105) or placebo (n = 103) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 16, Week 20, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 20 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of concomitant methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day), and/or NSAIDs during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited.\n\t•\tThe primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 20 response at Week 16. In this trial, golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ASAS 20 response at Week 16, where a greater percentage of patients treated with golimumab achieved a low level of disease activity (< 2 [on a scale of 0 to 10 cm] in all four ASAS domains) compared with patients treated with placebo (16.2% vs. 3.9%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary and mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36. Golimumab-treated patients showed significant improvement compared with placebo-treated patients in health related quality of life as assessed by the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life questionnaire (ASQoL).\n•\tPsoriatic Arthritis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 480 adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) despite NSAID or DMARD therapy. Previous treatment with a biologic was not allowed. Patients in this trial had a diagnosis of PsA for at least six months and had symptoms of active disease [≥ 5 swollen joints and ≥ 5 tender joints and a CRP level of ≥ 0.6 mg/dL]. Patients were randomized to either receive golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 241) or placebo (n = 239) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 24, Week 28, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 28 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of MTX, NSAIDs, and low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day) during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Patients with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with absence of rheumatoid nodules (44%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (19%), distal interphalangeal joint involvement (8.1%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (25%), and arthritis mutilans (4.8%). During the trial, concomitant medications used included MTX (70%), oral corticosteroids (28%), and NSAIDs (71%). Golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Similar ACR 20 responses at Week 24 were observed in patients with different PsA subtypes. ACR 20 responses observed in the golimumab-treated groups were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX. Patients with enthesitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) on a scale of 0-6. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement in enthesitis, with a mean reduction of 1.8 as compared with a mean reduction in placebo-treated patients of 0.8 at Week 14. Patients with dactylitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement on a scale of 0-60. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement, with a mean reduction of 7.8 compared with a mean reduction of 2.8 in placebo-treated patients at Week 14. Golimumab inhibited the progression of structural damage compared with placebo, as assessed by total modified vdH-S score. At Week 24, a greater proportion of patients in the golimumab group (72%) had no progression of structural damage (change in the total modified vdH-S score ≤ 0), compared to 43% of patients in the placebo group. Improvement in physical function as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) demonstrated that the proportion of patients who achieved clinically meaningful improvement of ≥ 0.3 in HAQ-DI score from baseline was greater in the golimumab-treated group compared to placebo at Week 14 (69% compared to 32%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary, mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36.\n•\tRheumatoid Arthritis\n\t•\tIn the extension phase to the GO-FURTHER pivotal study, the long-term extension study of golimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis evaluated the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and radiographic progression, through 100 weeks of therapy, where safety was monitored through 112 weeks. In the original trial 592 patients with active RA were randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous (IV) golimumab 2mg/kg plus MTX or placebo plus MTX at weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients receiving placebo were able to cross over at either week 16 or week 24 to active therapy. In total, 486 patients (82.1%) continued golimumab therapy for 100 weeks. Efficacy assessments included the American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, 70% (ACR 20, ACR50, ACR70) response criteria, 28 joint count disease activity score using the C-reactive protein level, physical function, and quality of life (QoL) measures, and changes in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde scores (SHS). Following treatment at week 100, in both groups combined, 68.1% of patients had an ACR20 response, 43.8% had an ACR50, and 23.5% had an ACR70 response. More than 80% of all patients had a good or moderate DAS28-CRP response at week 100, and approximately 28% achieved DAS28-CRP < 2.6. For patient reported outcomes, improvements in SF-36 PCS, MCS, FACIT-Fatigue, EQ-5D VAS scores were sustained through week 112 in both treatment groups. At week 100, the mean change from baseline in total SHS score was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (0.74 vs. 2.10; p = 0.005) and 61.8% (n = 244 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 54.8% (n = 108 of 197) of patients in Group 2 had a change from baseline in total SHS of ≤ 0. When evaluated by progression beyond the smallest detectable change (3.22) in total SHS, 16.7% (n = 66 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 23.9% (n = 47 of 197) in Group 2 demonstrated radiographic progression from baseline to week 100. The mean change in total SHS score from week 52 to week 100 when all patients were receiving golimumab was numerically lower in Group 1 (0.56) than in Group 2 (0.80); the median change was 0 in both groups. After 112 weeks, a total of 481 patients completed the safety follow-up with 79.1% had at least one adverse event, and 18.2% having had a serious adverse event. After 100 weeks of treatment only 6.7% (n = 37 of 553) of patients developed antibodies to golimumab, with 86.5% positive for neutralizing antibodies. The authors concluded that treatment with IV golimumab plus MTX afforded a clinical response that was maintained through week 100. Radiographic progression following treatment was clinically insignificant between week 52 and week 100.\n•\tPolyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA)\n\t•\tThe efficacy of golimumab in pediatric patients with pJIA is based on the pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of golimumab in RA patients. Efficacy of golimumab was also assessed in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in 127 children (2 to < 18 years of age) with JIA with active polyarthritis despite treatment with MTX for at least 2 months (Trial pJIA, NCT02277444). The polyarticular JIA patient subtypes at study entry included: rheumatoid factor negative (43%), rheumatoid factor positive (35%), enthesitis-related arthritis (9%), oligoarticular extended (6%), juvenile psoriatic arthritis (4%), and systemic JIA without systemic manifestations (3%). All patients received golimumab 80 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, 4, and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients continued stable doses of MTX weekly through Week 28; after Week 28, changes in MTX dose were permitted. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 52. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in patients with RA.",

    "summary": "Simponi Aria (golimumab) is a TNF blocker indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA in combination with methotrexate (MTX), active PsA in patients 2 years of age or older, active AS, and active pJIA in patients 2 years of age and older. For ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Simponi Aria is approved for initial therapy and continuation of therapy when specific criteria are met, including diagnosis of the respective condition, initiation and titration according to FDA labeled dosing, and not receiving Simponi Aria in combination with a targeted immunomodulator. For medical necessity, specific criteria must be met, including history of failure to previous treatments or being currently on Simponi Aria, and prescription by or in consultation with a specialist. Initial and reauthorizations are for no more than 12 months. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of golimumab in treating these conditions, with significant improvements in signs and symptoms compared to placebo. The policy was updated on 03/01/2025 to reflect current information and archived the previous version.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "•\tAnkylosing Spondylitis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 208 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and inadequate response or intolerance to NSAIDs. Patients had a diagnosis of definite AS for at least 3 months according to modified New York criteria. Patients had symptoms of active disease [Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥ 4, VAS for total back pain of ≥ 4, on scales of 0 to 10 cm (0 to 100 mm), and a hsCRP level of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (3 mg/L)]. Patients were randomized to receive either golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 105) or placebo (n = 103) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 16, Week 20, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 20 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of concomitant methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day), and/or NSAIDs during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited.\n\t•\tThe primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 20 response at Week 16. In this trial, golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ASAS 20 response at Week 16, where a greater percentage of patients treated with golimumab achieved a low level of disease activity (< 2 [on a scale of 0 to 10 cm] in all four ASAS domains) compared with patients treated with placebo (16.2% vs. 3.9%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary and mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36. Golimumab-treated patients showed significant improvement compared with placebo-treated patients in health related quality of life as assessed by the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life questionnaire (ASQoL).\n•\tPsoriatic Arthritis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 480 adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) despite NSAID or DMARD therapy. Previous treatment with a biologic was not allowed. Patients in this trial had a diagnosis of PsA for at least six months and had symptoms of active disease [≥ 5 swollen joints and ≥ 5 tender joints and a CRP level of ≥ 0.6 mg/dL]. Patients were randomized to either receive golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 241) or placebo (n = 239) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 24, Week 28, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 28 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of MTX, NSAIDs, and low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day) during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Patients with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with absence of rheumatoid nodules (44%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (19%), distal interphalangeal joint involvement (8.1%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (25%), and arthritis mutilans (4.8%). During the trial, concomitant medications used included MTX (70%), oral corticosteroids (28%), and NSAIDs (71%). Golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Similar ACR 20 responses at Week 24 were observed in patients with different PsA subtypes. ACR 20 responses observed in the golimumab-treated groups were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX. Patients with enthesitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) on a scale of 0-6. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement in enthesitis, with a mean reduction of 1.8 as compared with a mean reduction in placebo-treated patients of 0.8 at Week 14. Patients with dactylitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement on a scale of 0-60. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement, with a mean reduction of 7.8 compared with a mean reduction of 2.8 in placebo-treated patients at Week 14. Golimumab inhibited the progression of structural damage compared with placebo, as assessed by total modified vdH-S score. At Week 24, a greater proportion of patients in the golimumab group (72%) had no progression of structural damage (change in the total modified vdH-S score ≤ 0), compared to 43% of patients in the placebo group. Improvement in physical function as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) demonstrated that the proportion of patients who achieved clinically meaningful improvement of ≥ 0.3 in HAQ-DI score from baseline was greater in the golimumab-treated group compared to placebo at Week 14 (69% compared to 32%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary, mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36.\n•\tRheumatoid Arthritis\n\t•\tIn the extension phase to the GO-FURTHER pivotal study, the long-term extension study of golimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis evaluated the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and radiographic progression, through 100 weeks of therapy, where safety was monitored through 112 weeks. In the original trial 592 patients with active RA were randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous (IV) golimumab 2mg/kg plus MTX or placebo plus MTX at weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients receiving placebo were able to cross over at either week 16 or week 24 to active therapy. In total, 486 patients (82.1%) continued golimumab therapy for 100 weeks. Efficacy assessments included the American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, 70% (ACR 20, ACR50, ACR70) response criteria, 28 joint count disease activity score using the C-reactive protein level, physical function, and quality of life (QoL) measures, and changes in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde scores (SHS). Following treatment at week 100, in both groups combined, 68.1% of patients had an ACR20 response, 43.8% had an ACR50, and 23.5% had an ACR70 response. More than 80% of all patients had a good or moderate DAS28-CRP response at week 100, and approximately 28% achieved DAS28-CRP < 2.6. For patient reported outcomes, improvements in SF-36 PCS, MCS, FACIT-Fatigue, EQ-5D VAS scores were sustained through week 112 in both treatment groups. At week 100, the mean change from baseline in total SHS score was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (0.74 vs. 2.10; p = 0.005) and 61.8% (n = 244 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 54.8% (n = 108 of 197) of patients in Group 2 had a change from baseline in total SHS of ≤ 0. When evaluated by progression beyond the smallest detectable change (3.22) in total SHS, 16.7% (n = 66 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 23.9% (n = 47 of 197) in Group 2 demonstrated radiographic progression from baseline to week 100. The mean change in total SHS score from week 52 to week 100 when all patients were receiving golimumab was numerically lower in Group 1 (0.56) than in Group 2 (0.80); the median change was 0 in both groups. After 112 weeks, a total of 481 patients completed the safety follow-up with 79.1% had at least one adverse event, and 18.2% having had a serious adverse event. After 100 weeks of treatment only 6.7% (n = 37 of 553) of patients developed antibodies to golimumab, with 86.5% positive for neutralizing antibodies. The authors concluded that treatment with IV golimumab plus MTX afforded a clinical response that was maintained through week 100. Radiographic progression following treatment was clinically insignificant between week 52 and week 100.\n•\tPolyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA)\n\t•\tThe efficacy of golimumab in pediatric patients with pJIA is based on the pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of golimumab in RA patients. Efficacy of golimumab was also assessed in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in 127 children (2 to < 18 years of age) with JIA with active polyarthritis despite treatment with MTX for at least 2 months (Trial pJIA, NCT02277444). The polyarticular JIA patient subtypes at study entry included: rheumatoid factor negative (43%), rheumatoid factor positive (35%), enthesitis-related arthritis (9%), oligoarticular extended (6%), juvenile psoriatic arthritis (4%), and systemic JIA without systemic manifestations (3%). All patients received golimumab 80 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, 4, and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients continued stable doses of MTX weekly through Week 28; after Week 28, changes in MTX dose were permitted. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 52. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in patients with RA.",

    "summary": "Simponi Aria (golimumab) is a TNF blocker indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA in combination with methotrexate (MTX), active PsA in patients 2 years of age or older, active AS, and active pJIA in patients 2 years of age and older. For ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Simponi Aria is approved for initial therapy and continuation of therapy when specific criteria are met, including diagnosis of the respective condition, initiation and titration according to FDA labeled dosing, and not receiving Simponi Aria in combination with a targeted immunomodulator. For medical necessity, specific criteria must be met, including history of failure to previous treatments or being currently on Simponi Aria, and prescription by or in consultation with a specialist. Initial and reauthorizations are for no more than 12 months. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of golimumab in treating these conditions, with significant improvements in signs and symptoms compared to placebo. The policy was updated on 03/01/2025 to reflect current information and archived the previous version.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "•\tAnkylosing Spondylitis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 208 adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and inadequate response or intolerance to NSAIDs. Patients had a diagnosis of definite AS for at least 3 months according to modified New York criteria. Patients had symptoms of active disease [Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥ 4, VAS for total back pain of ≥ 4, on scales of 0 to 10 cm (0 to 100 mm), and a hsCRP level of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (3 mg/L)]. Patients were randomized to receive either golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 105) or placebo (n = 103) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 16, Week 20, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 20 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of concomitant methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day), and/or NSAIDs during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited.\n\t•\tThe primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 20 response at Week 16. In this trial, golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ASAS 20 response at Week 16, where a greater percentage of patients treated with golimumab achieved a low level of disease activity (< 2 [on a scale of 0 to 10 cm] in all four ASAS domains) compared with patients treated with placebo (16.2% vs. 3.9%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary and mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36. Golimumab-treated patients showed significant improvement compared with placebo-treated patients in health related quality of life as assessed by the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life questionnaire (ASQoL).\n•\tPsoriatic Arthritis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 480 adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) despite NSAID or DMARD therapy. Previous treatment with a biologic was not allowed. Patients in this trial had a diagnosis of PsA for at least six months and had symptoms of active disease [≥ 5 swollen joints and ≥ 5 tender joints and a CRP level of ≥ 0.6 mg/dL]. Patients were randomized to either receive golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 241) or placebo (n = 239) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 24, Week 28, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 28 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of MTX, NSAIDs, and low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day) during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Patients with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with absence of rheumatoid nodules (44%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (19%), distal interphalangeal joint involvement (8.1%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (25%), and arthritis mutilans (4.8%). During the trial, concomitant medications used included MTX (70%), oral corticosteroids (28%), and NSAIDs (71%). Golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Similar ACR 20 responses at Week 24 were observed in patients with different PsA subtypes. ACR 20 responses observed in the golimumab-treated groups were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX. Patients with enthesitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) on a scale of 0-6. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement in enthesitis, with a mean reduction of 1.8 as compared with a mean reduction in placebo-treated patients of 0.8 at Week 14. Patients with dactylitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement on a scale of 0-60. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement, with a mean reduction of 7.8 compared with a mean reduction of 2.8 in placebo-treated patients at Week 14. Golimumab inhibited the progression of structural damage compared with placebo, as assessed by total modified vdH-S score. At Week 24, a greater proportion of patients in the golimumab group (72%) had no progression of structural damage (change in the total modified vdH-S score ≤ 0), compared to 43% of patients in the placebo group. Improvement in physical function as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) demonstrated that the proportion of patients who achieved clinically meaningful improvement of ≥ 0.3 in HAQ-DI score from baseline was greater in the golimumab-treated group compared to placebo at Week 14 (69% compared to 32%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary, mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36.\n•\tRheumatoid Arthritis\n\t•\tIn the extension phase to the GO-FURTHER pivotal study, the long-term extension study of golimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis evaluated the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and radiographic progression, through 100 weeks of therapy, where safety was monitored through 112 weeks. In the original trial 592 patients with active RA were randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous (IV) golimumab 2mg/kg plus MTX or placebo plus MTX at weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients receiving placebo were able to cross over at either week 16 or week 24 to active therapy. In total, 486 patients (82.1%) continued golimumab therapy for 100 weeks. Efficacy assessments included the American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, 70% (ACR 20, ACR50, ACR70) response criteria, 28 joint count disease activity score using the C-reactive protein level, physical function, and quality of life (QoL) measures, and changes in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde scores (SHS). Following treatment at week 100, in both groups combined, 68.1% of patients had an ACR20 response, 43.8% had an ACR50, and 23.5% had an ACR70 response. More than 80% of all patients had a good or moderate DAS28-CRP response at week 100, and approximately 28% achieved DAS28-CRP < 2.6. For patient reported outcomes, improvements in SF-36 PCS, MCS, FACIT-Fatigue, EQ-5D VAS scores were sustained through week 112 in both treatment groups. At week 100, the mean change from baseline in total SHS score was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (0.74 vs. 2.10; p = 0.005) and 61.8% (n = 244 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 54.8% (n = 108 of 197) of patients in Group 2 had a change from baseline in total SHS of ≤ 0. When evaluated by progression beyond the smallest detectable change (3.22) in total SHS, 16.7% (n = 66 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 23.9% (n = 47 of 197) in Group 2 demonstrated radiographic progression from baseline to week 100. The mean change in total SHS score from week 52 to week 100 when all patients were receiving golimumab was numerically lower in Group 1 (0.56) than in Group 2 (0.80); the median change was 0 in both groups. After 112 weeks, a total of 481 patients completed the safety follow-up with 79.1% had at least one adverse event, and 18.2% having had a serious adverse event. After 100 weeks of treatment only 6.7% (n = 37 of 553) of patients developed antibodies to golimumab, with 86.5% positive for neutralizing antibodies. The authors concluded that treatment with IV golimumab plus MTX afforded a clinical response that was maintained through week 100. Radiographic progression following treatment was clinically insignificant between week 52 and week 100.\n•\tPolyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA)\n\t•\tThe efficacy of golimumab in pediatric patients with pJIA is based on the pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of golimumab in RA patients. Efficacy of golimumab was also assessed in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in 127 children (2 to < 18 years of age) with JIA with active polyarthritis despite treatment with MTX for at least 2 months (Trial pJIA, NCT02277444). The polyarticular JIA patient subtypes at study entry included: rheumatoid factor negative (43%), rheumatoid factor positive (35%), enthesitis-related arthritis (9%), oligoarticular extended (6%), juvenile psoriatic arthritis (4%), and systemic JIA without systemic manifestations (3%). All patients received golimumab 80 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, 4, and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients continued stable doses of MTX weekly through Week 28; after Week 28, changes in MTX dose were permitted. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 52. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in patients with RA.",

    "summary": "Simponi Aria (golimumab) is a TNF blocker indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA in combination with methotrexate (MTX), active PsA in patients 2 years of age or older, active AS, and active pJIA in patients 2 years of age and older. For ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Simponi Aria is approved for initial therapy and continuation of therapy when specific criteria are met, including diagnosis of the respective condition, initiation and titration according to FDA labeled dosing, and not receiving Simponi Aria in combination with a targeted immunomodulator. For medical necessity, specific criteria must be met, including history of failure to previous treatments or being currently on Simponi Aria, and prescription by or in consultation with a specialist. Initial and reauthorizations are for no more than 12 months. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of golimumab in treating these conditions, with significant improvements in signs and symptoms compared to placebo. The policy was updated on 03/01/2025 to reflect current information and archived the previous version.",

Patients had a diagnosis of definite AS for at least 3 months according to modified New York criteria. Patients had symptoms of active disease [Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) ≥ 4, VAS for total back pain of ≥ 4, on scales of 0 to 10 cm (0 to 100 mm), and a hsCRP level of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (3 mg/L)]. Patients were randomized to receive either golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 105) or placebo (n = 103) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 16, Week 20, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 20 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of concomitant methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day), and/or NSAIDs during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited.\n\t•\tThe primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 20 response at Week 16. In this trial, golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ASAS 20 response at Week 16, where a greater percentage of patients treated with golimumab achieved a low level of disease activity (< 2 [on a scale of 0 to 10 cm] in all four ASAS domains) compared with patients treated with placebo (16.2% vs. 3.9%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary and mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36. Golimumab-treated patients showed significant improvement compared with placebo-treated patients in health related quality of life as assessed by the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life questionnaire (ASQoL).\n•\tPsoriatic Arthritis\n\t•\tThe efficacy and safety of golimumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 480 adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) despite NSAID or DMARD therapy. Previous treatment with a biologic was not allowed. Patients in this trial had a diagnosis of PsA for at least six months and had symptoms of active disease [≥ 5 swollen joints and ≥ 5 tender joints and a CRP level of ≥ 0.6 mg/dL]. Patients were randomized to either receive golimumab 2 mg/kg (n = 241) or placebo (n = 239) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20. All patients on placebo received golimumab at Week 24, Week 28, and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the golimumab treatment group continued to receive golimumab infusions at Week 28 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of MTX, NSAIDs, and low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per day) during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Patients with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with absence of rheumatoid nodules (44%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (19%), distal interphalangeal joint involvement (8.1%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (25%), and arthritis mutilans (4.8%). During the trial, concomitant medications used included MTX (70%), oral corticosteroids (28%), and NSAIDs (71%). Golimumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a significant improvement in signs and symptoms as demonstrated by the percentage of patients with an ACR 20 response at Week 14. Similar ACR 20 responses at Week 24 were observed in patients with different PsA subtypes. ACR 20 responses observed in the golimumab-treated groups were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX. Patients with enthesitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) on a scale of 0-6. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement in enthesitis, with a mean reduction of 1.8 as compared with a mean reduction in placebo-treated patients of 0.8 at Week 14. Patients with dactylitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement on a scale of 0-60. Golimumab-treated patients showed a significantly greater improvement, with a mean reduction of 7.8 compared with a mean reduction of 2.8 in placebo-treated patients at Week 14. Golimumab inhibited the progression of structural damage compared with placebo, as assessed by total modified vdH-S score. At Week 24, a greater proportion of patients in the golimumab group (72%) had no progression of structural damage (change in the total modified vdH-S score ≤ 0), compared to 43% of patients in the placebo group. Improvement in physical function as assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) demonstrated that the proportion of patients who achieved clinically meaningful improvement of ≥ 0.3 in HAQ-DI score from baseline was greater in the golimumab-treated group compared to placebo at Week 14 (69% compared to 32%). General health status was assessed by the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Patients receiving golimumab demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared with placebo in physical component summary, mental component summary scores and in all 8 domains of the SF-36.\n•\tRheumatoid Arthritis\n\t•\tIn the extension phase to the GO-FURTHER pivotal study, the long-term extension study of golimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis evaluated the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and radiographic progression, through 100 weeks of therapy, where safety was monitored through 112 weeks. In the original trial 592 patients with active RA were randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous (IV) golimumab 2mg/kg plus MTX or placebo plus MTX at weeks 0, 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Patients receiving placebo were able to cross over at either week 16 or week 24 to active therapy. In total, 486 patients (82.1%) continued golimumab therapy for 100 weeks. Efficacy assessments included the American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, 70% (ACR 20, ACR50, ACR70) response criteria, 28 joint count disease activity score using the C-reactive protein level, physical function, and quality of life (QoL) measures, and changes in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde scores (SHS). Following treatment at week 100, in both groups combined, 68.1% of patients had an ACR20 response, 43.8% had an ACR50, and 23.5% had an ACR70 response. More than 80% of all patients had a good or moderate DAS28-CRP response at week 100, and approximately 28% achieved DAS28-CRP < 2.6. For patient reported outcomes, improvements in SF-36 PCS, MCS, FACIT-Fatigue, EQ-5D VAS scores were sustained through week 112 in both treatment groups. At week 100, the mean change from baseline in total SHS score was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (0.74 vs. 2.10; p = 0.005) and 61.8% (n = 244 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 54.8% (n = 108 of 197) of patients in Group 2 had a change from baseline in total SHS of ≤ 0. When evaluated by progression beyond the smallest detectable change (3.22) in total SHS, 16.7% (n = 66 of 395) of patients in Group 1 and 23.9% (n = 47 of 197) in Group 2 demonstrated radiographic progression from baseline to week 100. The mean change in total SHS score from week 52 to week 100 when all patients were receiving golimumab was numerically lower in Group 1 (0.56) than in Group 2 (0.80); the median change was 0 in both groups. After 112 weeks, a total of 481 patients completed the safety follow-up with 79.1% had at least one adverse event, and 18.2% having had a serious adverse event. After 100 weeks of treatment only 6.7% (n = 37 of 553) of patients developed antibodies to golimumab, with 86.5% positive for neutralizing antibodies. The authors concluded that treatment with IV golimumab plus MTX afforded a clinical response that was maintained through week 100. Radiographic progression following treatment was clinically insignificant between week 52 and week 100.\n•\tPolyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA)\n\t•\tThe efficacy of golimumab in pediatric patients with pJIA is based on the pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of golimumab in RA patients. Efficacy of golimumab was also assessed in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in 127 children (2 to < 18 years of age) with JIA with active polyarthritis despite treatment with MTX for at least 2 months (Trial pJIA, NCT02277444). The polyarticular JIA patient subtypes at study entry included: rheumatoid factor negative (43%), rheumatoid factor positive (35%), enthesitis-related arthritis (9%), oligoarticular extended (6%), juvenile psoriatic arthritis (4%), and systemic JIA without systemic manifestations (3%). All patients received golimumab 80 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, 4, and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients continued stable doses of MTX weekly through Week 28; after Week 28, changes in MTX dose were permitted. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 52.

    "rationale_for_use": "The document provides the coverage rationale for Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC).  \n\nFor Crohn’s Disease, Skyrizi is proven and medically necessary when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator.  For patients who have not previously been treated with a targeted immunomodulator, they must have a history of failure to one of the following conventional therapies at up to maximally indicated doses unless contraindicated or clinically significant adverse effects are experienced: Corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine, Azathioprine, or Methotrexate.  Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nClinical evidence is based on the ADVANCE and MOTIVATE trials.  ADVANCE and MOTIVATE were randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, phase 3 induction studies. Eligible patients aged 16–80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, previously showing intolerance or inadequate response to one or more approved biologics or conventional therapy (ADVANCE) or to biologics (MOTIVATE), were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of intravenous risankizumab (600 mg or 1200 mg) or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8. All coprimary endpoints at week 12 were met in both trials with both doses of risankizumab (p values ≤ 0·0001). In ADVANCE, CDAI clinical remission rate was 45% with risankizumab 600 mg and 42% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 25% with placebo; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission rate was 43% with risankizumab 600 mg and 41% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 22% with placebo; and endoscopic response rate was 40% with risankizumab 600 mg and 32% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 12% with placebo. In MOTIVATE, CDAI clinical remission rate was 42% with risankizumab 600 mg and 40% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 20% with placebo; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission rate was 35% with risankizumab 600 mg and 40% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 19% with placebo; and endoscopic response rate was 29% with risankizumab 600 mg and 34% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 11% with placebo.\n\nFORTIFY is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, maintenance withdrawal study across 273 clinical centers in 44 countries that enrolled participants with clinical response to risankizumab in the ADVANCE or MOTIVATE induction studies. Patients in ADVANCE or MOTIVATE were aged 16–80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Patients in the FORTIFY sub study 1 were randomly assigned again to receive either subcutaneous risankizumab 180 mg, subcutaneous risankizumab 360 mg, or withdrawal from risankizumab to receive subcutaneous placebo. Greater clinical remission and endoscopic response rates were reached with 360 mg risankizumab versus placebo (CDAI clinical remission was reached in 52% of patients vs 41% of patients, adjusted difference 15% [95% CI 5–24]; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission was reached in 52% vs 40%, adjusted difference 15% [5–25]; endoscopic response 47% of patients vs 22% of patients, adjusted difference 28% [19–37]). Higher rates of CDAI clinical remission and endoscopic response were also reached with risankizumab 180 mg versus withdrawal.\n\nFor Ulcerative Colitis, Skyrizi is proven and medically necessary when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator.  Patients must have had prior or concurrent inadequate response to a therapeutic course of oral corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants; or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator FDA-approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.  Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nClinical evidence is based on the INSPIRE and COMMAND trials.  In the 12-week induction study, INSPIRE, 966 subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis were randomized and received risankizumab 1,200 mg or placebo as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8. At baseline in INSPIRE, the median mMS was 7; 37% had severely active disease; 69% had an ES of 3. In INSPIRE, 52% of subjects had failed treatment with one or more biologics, JAKi or S1PRM. In INSPIRE, the primary endpoint was clinical remission defined using the mMS at Week 12 (total population clinical remission was 24% with risankizumab vs. 8% with placebo). Key secondary endpoints included clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement (total population clinical response was 65% on risankizumab vs. 36% on placebo, endoscopic improvement was 36% on risankizumab vs. 12% on placebo, and histiologic endoscopic mucosal improvement was 24% on risankizumab vs. 7% on placebo).\n\nThe maintenance study, COMMAND evaluated 547 subjects who received one of three SKYRIZI induction regimens, including the 1,200 mg regimen, for 12 weeks in Studies UC-1 or UC-3 and demonstrated clinical response per mMS after 12 weeks. Subjects were randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of subcutaneous (SC) SKYRIZI 180 mg or SKYRIZI 360 mg or placebo at Week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter for up to an additional 52 weeks. In COMMAND, 75% of subjects had failed treatment with one or more biologics, JAKi, or S1PRM. The primary endpoint in COMMAND was clinical remission using mMS at Week 52 (total population clinical remission was 45% with risankizumab vs. 26% with placebo). Key secondary endpoints included corticosteroid-free clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, and histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement (total population corticosteroid-free clinical remission was 45% on risankizumab vs. 26% on placebo, endoscopic improvement was 51% on risankizumab vs. 31% on placebo, and histiologic endoscopic mucosal improvement was 43% on risankizumab vs. 24% on placebo).",

    "rationale_for_use": "The document provides the coverage rationale for Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC).  \n\nFor Crohn’s Disease, Skyrizi is proven and medically necessary when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator.  For patients who have not previously been treated with a targeted immunomodulator, they must have a history of failure to one of the following conventional therapies at up to maximally indicated doses unless contraindicated or clinically significant adverse effects are experienced: Corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine, Azathioprine, or Methotrexate.  Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nClinical evidence is based on the ADVANCE and MOTIVATE trials.  ADVANCE and MOTIVATE were randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, phase 3 induction studies. Eligible patients aged 16–80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, previously showing intolerance or inadequate response to one or more approved biologics or conventional therapy (ADVANCE) or to biologics (MOTIVATE), were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of intravenous risankizumab (600 mg or 1200 mg) or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8. All coprimary endpoints at week 12 were met in both trials with both doses of risankizumab (p values ≤ 0·0001). In ADVANCE, CDAI clinical remission rate was 45% with risankizumab 600 mg and 42% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 25% with placebo; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission rate was 43% with risankizumab 600 mg and 41% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 22% with placebo; and endoscopic response rate was 40% with risankizumab 600 mg and 32% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 12% with placebo. In MOTIVATE, CDAI clinical remission rate was 42% with risankizumab 600 mg and 40% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 20% with placebo; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission rate was 35% with risankizumab 600 mg and 40% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 19% with placebo; and endoscopic response rate was 29% with risankizumab 600 mg and 34% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 11% with placebo.\n\nFORTIFY is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, maintenance withdrawal study across 273 clinical centers in 44 countries that enrolled participants with clinical response to risankizumab in the ADVANCE or MOTIVATE induction studies. Patients in ADVANCE or MOTIVATE were aged 16–80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Patients in the FORTIFY sub study 1 were randomly assigned again to receive either subcutaneous risankizumab 180 mg, subcutaneous risankizumab 360 mg, or withdrawal from risankizumab to receive subcutaneous placebo. Greater clinical remission and endoscopic response rates were reached with 360 mg risankizumab versus placebo (CDAI clinical remission was reached in 52% of patients vs 41% of patients, adjusted difference 15% [95% CI 5–24]; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission was reached in 52% vs 40%, adjusted difference 15% [5–25]; endoscopic response 47% of patients vs 22% of patients, adjusted difference 28% [19–37]). Higher rates of CDAI clinical remission and endoscopic response were also reached with risankizumab 180 mg versus withdrawal.\n\nFor Ulcerative Colitis, Skyrizi is proven and medically necessary when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator.  Patients must have had prior or concurrent inadequate response to a therapeutic course of oral corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants; or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator FDA-approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.  Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nClinical evidence is based on the INSPIRE and COMMAND trials.  In the 12-week induction study, INSPIRE, 966 subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis were randomized and received risankizumab 1,200 mg or placebo as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8. At baseline in INSPIRE, the median mMS was 7; 37% had severely active disease; 69% had an ES of 3. In INSPIRE, 52% of subjects had failed treatment with one or more biologics, JAKi or S1PRM. In INSPIRE, the primary endpoint was clinical remission defined using the mMS at Week 12 (total population clinical remission was 24% with risankizumab vs. 8% with placebo). Key secondary endpoints included clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement (total population clinical response was 65% on risankizumab vs. 36% on placebo, endoscopic improvement was 36% on risankizumab vs. 12% on placebo, and histiologic endoscopic mucosal improvement was 24% on risankizumab vs. 7% on placebo).\n\nThe maintenance study, COMMAND evaluated 547 subjects who received one of three SKYRIZI induction regimens, including the 1,200 mg regimen, for 12 weeks in Studies UC-1 or UC-3 and demonstrated clinical response per mMS after 12 weeks. Subjects were randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of subcutaneous (SC) SKYRIZI 180 mg or SKYRIZI 360 mg or placebo at Week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter for up to an additional 52 weeks. In COMMAND, 75% of subjects had failed treatment with one or more biologics, JAKi, or S1PRM. The primary endpoint in COMMAND was clinical remission using mMS at Week 52 (total population clinical remission was 45% with risankizumab vs. 26% with placebo). Key secondary endpoints included corticosteroid-free clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, and histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement (total population corticosteroid-free clinical remission was 45% on risankizumab vs. 26% on placebo, endoscopic improvement was 51% on risankizumab vs. 31% on placebo, and histiologic endoscopic mucosal improvement was 43% on risankizumab vs. 24% on placebo).",

    "summary": "Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. It is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in adults.\n\nFor Crohn’s Disease, Skyrizi is covered when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator. For patients who have not previously been treated with a targeted immunomodulator, they must have a history of failure to one of the following conventional therapies at up to maximally indicated doses unless contraindicated or clinically significant adverse effects are experienced: Corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine, Azathioprine, or Methotrexate. Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nFor Ulcerative Colitis, Skyrizi is covered when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator. Patients must have had prior or concurrent inadequate response to a therapeutic course of oral corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants; or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator FDA-approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nThe policy provides clinical evidence from the ADVANCE, MOTIVATE, FORTIFY, INSPIRE, and COMMAND trials to support the use of Skyrizi in these patient populations. The policy was updated on 08/01/2025 to revise the list of targeted immunomodulators that should not be used in combination with Skyrizi and to update the references section.",

    "rationale_for_use": "The document provides the coverage rationale for Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC).  \n\nFor Crohn’s Disease, Skyrizi is proven and medically necessary when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator.  For patients who have not previously been treated with a targeted immunomodulator, they must have a history of failure to one of the following conventional therapies at up to maximally indicated doses unless contraindicated or clinically significant adverse effects are experienced: Corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine, Azathioprine, or Methotrexate.  Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nClinical evidence is based on the ADVANCE and MOTIVATE trials.  ADVANCE and MOTIVATE were randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, phase 3 induction studies. Eligible patients aged 16–80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, previously showing intolerance or inadequate response to one or more approved biologics or conventional therapy (ADVANCE) or to biologics (MOTIVATE), were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of intravenous risankizumab (600 mg or 1200 mg) or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8. All coprimary endpoints at week 12 were met in both trials with both doses of risankizumab (p values ≤ 0·0001). In ADVANCE, CDAI clinical remission rate was 45% with risankizumab 600 mg and 42% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 25% with placebo; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission rate was 43% with risankizumab 600 mg and 41% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 22% with placebo; and endoscopic response rate was 40% with risankizumab 600 mg and 32% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 12% with placebo. In MOTIVATE, CDAI clinical remission rate was 42% with risankizumab 600 mg and 40% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 20% with placebo; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission rate was 35% with risankizumab 600 mg and 40% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 19% with placebo; and endoscopic response rate was 29% with risankizumab 600 mg and 34% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 11% with placebo.\n\nFORTIFY is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, maintenance withdrawal study across 273 clinical centers in 44 countries that enrolled participants with clinical response to risankizumab in the ADVANCE or MOTIVATE induction studies. Patients in ADVANCE or MOTIVATE were aged 16–80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Patients in the FORTIFY sub study 1 were randomly assigned again to receive either subcutaneous risankizumab 180 mg, subcutaneous risankizumab 360 mg, or withdrawal from risankizumab to receive subcutaneous placebo. Greater clinical remission and endoscopic response rates were reached with 360 mg risankizumab versus placebo (CDAI clinical remission was reached in 52% of patients vs 41% of patients, adjusted difference 15% [95% CI 5–24]; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission was reached in 52% vs 40%, adjusted difference 15% [5–25]; endoscopic response 47% of patients vs 22% of patients, adjusted difference 28% [19–37]). Higher rates of CDAI clinical remission and endoscopic response were also reached with risankizumab 180 mg versus withdrawal.\n\nFor Ulcerative Colitis, Skyrizi is proven and medically necessary when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator.  Patients must have had prior or concurrent inadequate response to a therapeutic course of oral corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants; or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator FDA-approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.  Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nClinical evidence is based on the INSPIRE and COMMAND trials.  In the 12-week induction study, INSPIRE, 966 subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis were randomized and received risankizumab 1,200 mg or placebo as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8. At baseline in INSPIRE, the median mMS was 7; 37% had severely active disease; 69% had an ES of 3. In INSPIRE, 52% of subjects had failed treatment with one or more biologics, JAKi or S1PRM. In INSPIRE, the primary endpoint was clinical remission defined using the mMS at Week 12 (total population clinical remission was 24% with risankizumab vs. 8% with placebo). Key secondary endpoints included clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement (total population clinical response was 65% on risankizumab vs. 36% on placebo, endoscopic improvement was 36% on risankizumab vs. 12% on placebo, and histiologic endoscopic mucosal improvement was 24% on risankizumab vs. 7% on placebo).\n\nThe maintenance study, COMMAND evaluated 547 subjects who received one of three SKYRIZI induction regimens, including the 1,200 mg regimen, for 12 weeks in Studies UC-1 or UC-3 and demonstrated clinical response per mMS after 12 weeks. Subjects were randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of subcutaneous (SC) SKYRIZI 180 mg or SKYRIZI 360 mg or placebo at Week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter for up to an additional 52 weeks. In COMMAND, 75% of subjects had failed treatment with one or more biologics, JAKi, or S1PRM. The primary endpoint in COMMAND was clinical remission using mMS at Week 52 (total population clinical remission was 45% with risankizumab vs. 26% with placebo). Key secondary endpoints included corticosteroid-free clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, and histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement (total population corticosteroid-free clinical remission was 45% on risankizumab vs. 26% on placebo, endoscopic improvement was 51% on risankizumab vs. 31% on placebo, and histiologic endoscopic mucosal improvement was 43% on risankizumab vs. 24% on placebo).",

    "summary": "Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. It is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in adults.\n\nFor Crohn’s Disease, Skyrizi is covered when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator. For patients who have not previously been treated with a targeted immunomodulator, they must have a history of failure to one of the following conventional therapies at up to maximally indicated doses unless contraindicated or clinically significant adverse effects are experienced: Corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine, Azathioprine, or Methotrexate. Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nFor Ulcerative Colitis, Skyrizi is covered when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator. Patients must have had prior or concurrent inadequate response to a therapeutic course of oral corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants; or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator FDA-approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nThe policy provides clinical evidence from the ADVANCE, MOTIVATE, FORTIFY, INSPIRE, and COMMAND trials to support the use of Skyrizi in these patient populations. The policy was updated on 08/01/2025 to revise the list of targeted immunomodulators that should not be used in combination with Skyrizi and to update the references section.",

    "rationale_for_use": "The document provides the coverage rationale for Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC).  \n\nFor Crohn’s Disease, Skyrizi is proven and medically necessary when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator.  For patients who have not previously been treated with a targeted immunomodulator, they must have a history of failure to one of the following conventional therapies at up to maximally indicated doses unless contraindicated or clinically significant adverse effects are experienced: Corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine, Azathioprine, or Methotrexate.  Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nClinical evidence is based on the ADVANCE and MOTIVATE trials.  ADVANCE and MOTIVATE were randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, phase 3 induction studies. Eligible patients aged 16–80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, previously showing intolerance or inadequate response to one or more approved biologics or conventional therapy (ADVANCE) or to biologics (MOTIVATE), were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of intravenous risankizumab (600 mg or 1200 mg) or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8. All coprimary endpoints at week 12 were met in both trials with both doses of risankizumab (p values ≤ 0·0001). In ADVANCE, CDAI clinical remission rate was 45% with risankizumab 600 mg and 42% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 25% with placebo; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission rate was 43% with risankizumab 600 mg and 41% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 22% with placebo; and endoscopic response rate was 40% with risankizumab 600 mg and 32% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 12% with placebo. In MOTIVATE, CDAI clinical remission rate was 42% with risankizumab 600 mg and 40% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 20% with placebo; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission rate was 35% with risankizumab 600 mg and 40% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 19% with placebo; and endoscopic response rate was 29% with risankizumab 600 mg and 34% with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 11% with placebo.\n\nFORTIFY is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, maintenance withdrawal study across 273 clinical centers in 44 countries that enrolled participants with clinical response to risankizumab in the ADVANCE or MOTIVATE induction studies. Patients in ADVANCE or MOTIVATE were aged 16–80 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Patients in the FORTIFY sub study 1 were randomly assigned again to receive either subcutaneous risankizumab 180 mg, subcutaneous risankizumab 360 mg, or withdrawal from risankizumab to receive subcutaneous placebo. Greater clinical remission and endoscopic response rates were reached with 360 mg risankizumab versus placebo (CDAI clinical remission was reached in 52% of patients vs 41% of patients, adjusted difference 15% [95% CI 5–24]; stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission was reached in 52% vs 40%, adjusted difference 15% [5–25]; endoscopic response 47% of patients vs 22% of patients, adjusted difference 28% [19–37]). Higher rates of CDAI clinical remission and endoscopic response were also reached with risankizumab 180 mg versus withdrawal.\n\nFor Ulcerative Colitis, Skyrizi is proven and medically necessary when the patient has a diagnosis of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, is to be administered three intravenous induction doses in accordance with FDA labeled dosing, and is not receiving Skyrizi in combination with another targeted immunomodulator.  Patients must have had prior or concurrent inadequate response to a therapeutic course of oral corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants; or have been previously treated with a targeted immunomodulator FDA-approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.  Prescription must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.\n\nClinical evidence is based on the INSPIRE and COMMAND trials.  In the 12-week induction study, INSPIRE, 966 subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis were randomized and received risankizumab 1,200 mg or placebo as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8. At baseline in INSPIRE, the median mMS was 7; 37% had severely active disease; 69% had an ES of 3. In INSPIRE, 52% of subjects had failed treatment with one or more biologics, JAKi or S1PRM. In INSPIRE, the primary endpoint was clinical remission defined using the mMS at Week 12 (total population clinical remission was 24% with risankizumab vs. 8% with placebo). Key secondary endpoints included clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement (total population clinical response was 65% on risankizumab vs. 36% on placebo, endoscopic improvement was 36% on risankizumab vs. 12% on placebo, and histiologic endoscopic mucosal improvement was 24% on risankizumab vs. 7% on placebo).\n\nThe maintenance study, COMMAND evaluated 547 subjects who received one of three SKYRIZI induction regimens, including the 1,200 mg regimen, for 12 weeks in Studies UC-1 or UC-3 and demonstrated clinical response per mMS after 12 weeks. Subjects were randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of subcutaneous (SC) SKYRIZI 180 mg or SKYRIZI 360 mg or placebo at Week 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter for up to an additional 52 weeks. In COMMAND, 75% of subjects had failed treatment with one or more biologics, JAKi, or S1PRM. The primary endpoint in COMMAND was clinical remission using mMS at Week 52 (total population clinical remission was 45% with risankizumab vs. 26% with placebo). Key secondary endpoints included corticosteroid-free clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, and histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement (total population corticosteroid-free clinical remission was 45% on risankizumab vs. 26% on placebo, endoscopic improvement was 51% on risankizumab vs. 31% on placebo, and histiologic endoscopic mucosal improvement was 43% on risankizumab vs. 24% on placebo).",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Pre-Symptomatic Patients Likely to Develop Type I SMA\n• An ongoing phase 2 clinical trial (NURTURE) is evaluating the effect of Spinraza treatment on pre-symptomatic SMA patients.22 Twenty-five patients with an SMN1 deletion with two or three copies of SMN2 received Spinraza treatment before 6 weeks of age, in advance of the onset of overt disease symptoms. The NURTURE trial is an open-label, single-arm study comparing pre-symptomatic Spinraza efficacy to a control group of affected siblings and natural history data.\n• An interim analysis was performed after all patients had received Spinraza for 14 months (median 25 months, range 14 to 34 months). At the time of interim analysis (data cutoff May 2018), all patients receiving Spinraza before the onset of SMA symptoms survived without requiring permanent ventilation, and beyond what would be expected based on their SMN2 copy number. All 25 patients (100%) had achieved the WHO motor milestone of sitting without support, and 22 patients (88%) had achieved the milestone of walking with assistance. Of the 22 patients who were older than the age expected to have achieved the ability to walk independently (as defined by the 95th percentile of the WHO expected age of achievement), 17 (77%) achieved the milestone of walking alone (i.e., walking independently).1,23\nType I SMA\n• A Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled study (ENDEAR study) assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of nusinersen, administered intrathecally in 121 symptomatic infants, ≤ 7 months of age at the time of first dose, diagnosed with SMA (symptom onset before 6 months of age). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either nusinersen or sham injection. Patients received nusinersen 12mg, or sham procedure on day 1, 15, 29, 64 and then maintenance dosing of 12 mg every 4 months. A planned interim efficacy analysis was conducted based on patients who died, withdrew, or completed at least 183 days of treatment. Of the 82 patients included in the interim analysis, 44% were male and 56% were female. Age at first treatment ranged from 30 to 262 days (median 181). Eighty-seven (87%) of subjects were Caucasian, 2% were Black, and 4% were Asian. Length of treatment ranged from 6 to 442 days (median 261 days). Baseline demographics were balanced between the nusinersen and control groups with the exception of age at first treatment (median age 175 vs. 206 days, respectively). The nusinersen and control groups were balanced with respect to gestational age, birth weight, disease duration, and SMN2 copy number (2 copies in 98% of subjects in both groups). Median disease duration was 14 weeks. There was some imbalance in age at symptom onset with 88% of subjects in the nusinersen group and 77% in the control group experiencing symptoms within the first 12 weeks of life.\n• The primary endpoint assessed at the time of interim analysis was the proportion of responders: patients with an improvement in motor milestones according to Section 2 of the Hammersmith Infant Neurologic Exam (HINE). A treatment responder was defined as any patient with at least a 2-point increase (or maximal score of 4) in ability to kick (consistent with improvement by at least 2 milestones), or at least a 1-point increase in the motor milestones of head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, or walking (consistent with improvement by at least 1 milestone). To be classified as a responder, patients needed to exhibit improvement in more categories of motor milestones than worsening. Of the 82 patients who were eligible for the interim analysis, a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients achieved a motor milestone response in the nusinersen group compared to the sham-control group. Fifty-one percent of patients in the nusinersen group achieved the definition of a motor milestone responder compared to 0% of patients in the sham-control group. The primary endpoint assessed at the final analysis was time to death or permanent ventilation (≥ 16 hours ventilation/day continuously for > 21 days in the absence of an acute reversible event or tracheostomy). Statistically significant effects on event-free survival and overall survival were observed in patients in the nusinersen group compared to those in the sham-control group. A 47% reduction in the risk of death or permanent ventilation was observed in the nusinersen group (p = 0.005). Median time to death or permanent ventilation was not reached in nusinersen group and was 22.6 weeks in the sham-control group. A statistically significant 63% reduction in the risk of death was also observed (p = 0.004).1,4\nType II/III SMA\n• A Phase 3 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, sham-procedure controlled study (CHERISH) assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of nusinersen in patients with later-onset SMA consistent with Type II or Type III SMA. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive intrathecal nusinersen or a sham procedure control, respectively. Patients received nusinersen 12 mg loading dose, or sham procedure on day 1, 29, 85 and then maintenance dosing of 12 mg six months after the last dose on day 274. The loading dose level and interval was selected based on the nonclinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacology data as the dose interval to achieve and maintain nusinersen spinal cord tissue levels that are predicted to be within the upper end of the pharmacologically active range following the first dose (predicted to be approximately 24 mcg/g lumbar and 8 mcg/g cervical tissue concentration at day 85), while at the same time considering subject safety and convenience for repeated LP intrathecal injections. The maintenance dose interval (once every 6 months) was selected based on the estimated spinal tissue and CSF drug half-life (4-6 months) and was selected to maintain spinal cord tissue levels of nusinersen at a steady-state level within the estimated pharmacologically active range.18 The CHERISH protocol was drafted, and thus the study regimen was selected, after the ENDEAR study amendment that increased the dosing frequency in patient with type 1 SMA. Inclusion criteria included diagnosis with SMA with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with SMA at greater than 6 months of age, an age of 2 to 12 years, the ability to sit independently, but never able to walk independently (defined as the ability to walk ≥ 15 ft. unaided) and have a HFMSE score greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 54 at Screening. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HFMSE score (at 15 months). Secondary Endpoints were (at 15 months): proportion of subjects who achieve a 3-point increase from baseline in HFMSE score, proportion of subject that achieve any new motor milestone, number of motor milestones achieved per subject, change from baseline in Upper Limb Module Test, proportion of subjects that achieve standing alone, proportion of subject that achieve walking with assistance. 126 children were enrolled in the trial with 84 receiving nusinersen. 90% of children had an SMN2 copy number of 3 or greater. In the pre-planned interim analysis, a significant difference (p = 0.0000002) of 5.9 points in HFMSE was observed at 15 months between patients given nusinersen (n = 84) compared to the sham-procedure control (n = 42) and the study was stopped early. Patients receiving nusinersen experienced a mean improvement of 4.0 points in the HFMSE compared to a mean decrease of 1.9 points in the sham procedure control group in the interim analysis. In the final analysis, Patients receiving nusinersen experienced a mean improvement of 3.9 points in the HFMSE compared to a mean decrease of 1.0 points in the sham procedure control group. A change of ≥ 3 points in the HFMSE has previously been determined to be clinically important. Subgroup analysis showed similar efficacy of nusinersen in type II/III SMA patients regardless of SMN2 copy number. 57% of the children in the nusinersen group as compared with 26% in the control group had an increase from baseline to month 15 in the HFMSE score of at least 3 points (p < 0.001) The percentage of children who achieved at least one new motor milestone did not differ significantly between the nusinersen group and the control group. The proportion of children who had achieved the ability to stand alone or walk with assistance did not differ significantly between groups. Adverse events were mostly considered to be related to SMA disease, common events found in the general population, or events related to the lumbar puncture procedure. No patients discontinued the study. Nusinersen was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.2,3",

    "summary": "Spinraza (nusinersen) is a medication used for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in pediatric and adult patients. UHC covers Spinraza for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SMA who meet specific criteria for initial or continuation therapy. Initial therapy requires confirmation of a genetic mutation, the patient not being dependent on invasive ventilation, and baseline motor ability assessment. Continuation therapy requires documentation of a positive clinical response to Spinraza. The rationale for coverage is based on clinical trials such as ENDEAR and CHERISH, which demonstrated improvements in motor function and survival. Spinraza is administered intrathecally. The initial authorization is for no more than 4 loading doses, and reauthorization is for no more than 3 maintenance doses (12 months). Exclusions include SMA without chromosome 5q mutations or concomitant treatment with other SMN modifying therapies. The policy has been revised to remove the tracheostomy dependence criterion and update documentation requirements.",

Coverage is provided for premature infants, children with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, congenital abnormalities of the airway or neuromuscular disease, immunocompromised children, and those with cystic fibrosis with other qualifying indications. The coverage is based on the medical necessity to prevent serious RSV infections in these high-risk groups. Synagis is not proven effective for infants with mild conditions or for routine use in children with Down syndrome or cystic fibrosis without specific qualifying conditions.

PATHWAY was a 52-week dose-ranging study in which patients received tezepelumab-ekko 70 mg every 4 weeks, Tezspire 210 mg every 4 weeks, tezepelumab-ekko 280 mg every 2 weeks, or placebo. NAVIGATOR was a 52-week study in which patients received Tezepelumab 210 mg every 4 weeks or placebo. The primary endpoint in both studies was the rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations measured over 52 weeks. Asthma exacerbations were defined as worsening of asthma requiring the use of or increase in oral or injectable corticosteroids for at least 3 days, or a single depo-injection of corticosteroids, and/or emergency department visits requiring use of oral or injectable corticosteroids and/or hospitalization. In PATHWAY, the annualized rate of asthma exacerbations was 0.20 with tezepelumab vs. 0.72 with placebo (rate ratio 0.29, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.51). In NAVIGATOR, the annualized rate of asthma exacerbations was 0.93 with tezepelumab vs. 2.10 with placebo (rate ratio 0.44, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.53). In NAVIGATOR, patients receiving tezepelumab experienced fewer exacerbations than those receiving placebo regardless of baseline levels of blood eosinophils or fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Similar results were seen in PATHWAY.\nTezepelumab was also evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in 150 adult patients with severe asthma requiring treatment with daily oral corticosteroids (OCS). Patients received tezepelumab 210 mg every 4 weeks or placebo. The primary endpoint was categorized percent reduction from baseline of the final OCS dose at week 48 (≥ 90% reduction, ≥ 75% to < 90% reduction, ≥ 50% to < 75% reduction, > 0% to < 50% reduction, and no change or no decrease in OCS), while maintaining asthma control.

    "summary": "Tezspire (tezepelumab-ekko) is a human monoclonal antibody indicated for add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. It works by blocking TSLP, reducing downstream markers of inflammation. UHC covers Tezspire for provider administration when specific criteria are met, including a diagnosis of severe asthma, use as add-on maintenance therapy, and adherence to FDA-approved labeling. For initial therapy, authorization is for no more than 12 months. Continuation of therapy requires documentation of positive clinical response and use in combination with an ICS-containing maintenance medication, while avoiding combination with anti-interleukin 5, anti-IgE, or anti-interleukin 4 therapies. Dosing must align with FDA-approved labeling, and reauthorization is limited to 12 months. The policy emphasizes the medical necessity of Tezspire when asthma is uncontrolled or inadequately controlled, despite the use of maximally-dosed ICS/LABA products or combination therapies. Clinical evidence supporting Tezspire includes the PATHWAY and NAVIGATOR studies, which demonstrated reduced asthma exacerbations.

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Ulcerative Colitis\nInduction Trial: UC1\nIn the 12-week induction study (UC1; NCT04033445), 701 subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis were randomized 3:2 to receive either Tremfya 200 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8. Disease activity was assessed by the modified Mayo score (mMS), a 3-component Mayo score (0-9) which consists of the following subscores (0 to 3 for each subscore): stool frequency (SFS), rectal bleeding (RBS), and findings on centrally reviewed endoscopy (ES). An ES of 2 was defined by marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, and/or erosions; an ES of 3 was defined by spontaneous bleeding and ulceration. Enrolled subjects with a mMS between 5 and 9 and an ES of 2 or 3 were classified as having moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Subjects with inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to corticosteroids, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine), biologic therapy (TNF blockers, vedolizumab), and/or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors were enrolled.\nAt baseline in UC1, the median mMS was 7, 64% of subjects had severely active disease (mMS ≥ 7), and 68% of subjects had an ES of 3. In UC1, 49% of subjects had previously failed (inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance) treatment with at least one biologic therapy and/or JAK inhibitor, 48% were biologic and JAK inhibitor naïve, and 3% had previously received but not failed a biologic or JAK inhibitor. The median age was 39 years (ranging from 18 to 79 years); 43% were female; and 72% identified as White, 21% as Asian, 1% as Black or African American, < 1% as American Indian or Alaskan Native, and < 1% as multiple racial groups.\nEnrolled subjects were permitted to use stable doses of oral aminosalicylates, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate), and/or oral corticosteroids (up to 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent). At baseline, 72% of subjects were receiving aminosalicylates, 21% of subjects were receiving immunomodulators, and 43% of subjects were receiving corticosteroids. Concomitant biologic therapies or JAK inhibitors were not permitted.\nIn UC1, the primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 12 as defined by the mMS. Secondary endpoints at Week 12 included endoscopic improvement, clinical response, and histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement. Clinical remission was achieved in 23% of patients with Tremfya vs. 8% with placebo (treatment difference 15%, 95% CI: 10, 20; p < 0.001).\nMaintenance Trial: UC2\nThe maintenance trial (UC2) evaluated 568 subjects who received one of two intravenous Tremfya induction regimens, including the recommended 200 mg regimen, for 12 weeks in Studies UC1 or UC3 (induction dose-finding study) and demonstrated clinical response per mMS after 12 weeks. Subjects were rerandomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either Tremfya 100 mg every 8 weeks, Tremfya 200 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo for up to an additional 44 weeks.\nIn UC2, 42% of subjects had failed (inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance) treatment with one or more biologics or JAK inhibitors.\nThe primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 44 defined by mMS. Secondary endpoints included corticosteroid-free clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement, all at Week 44 and maintenance of clinical remission at Week 44 in subjects who achieved clinical remission 12 weeks after intravenous Tremfya induction treatment. Clinical remission was achieved in 45% of patients with Tremfya 100 mg, 50% with Tremfya 200 mg, and 19% with placebo. Treatment difference vs. placebo was 25% (95% CI: 16, 34; p < 0.001) for Tremfya 100 mg and 30% (95% CI: 21, 38; p < 0.001) for Tremfya 200 mg.",

    "summary": "Tremfya (guselkumab) is a human monoclonal IgG1λ antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23 (IL-23) and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. UHC covers Tremfya for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s Disease in adult patients who meet specific criteria, including diagnosis confirmation, administration protocols (three intravenous induction doses), and lack of concurrent use with other targeted immunomodulators. For ulcerative colitis, patients must have had prior inadequate response to corticosteroids/immunosuppressants or prior treatment with a targeted immunomodulator. For Crohn’s disease, patients must have a history of failure to conventional therapies or prior treatment with a targeted immunomodulator. Prescriptions must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist. Clinical evidence from the UC1 and UC2 trials supports the use of Tremfya in ulcerative colitis, demonstrating clinical remission and endoscopic improvement. The policy was updated on 05/01/2025 to include coverage criteria for Crohn’s disease.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Ulcerative Colitis\nInduction Trial: UC1\nIn the 12-week induction study (UC1; NCT04033445), 701 subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis were randomized 3:2 to receive either Tremfya 200 mg or placebo by intravenous infusion at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8. Disease activity was assessed by the modified Mayo score (mMS), a 3-component Mayo score (0-9) which consists of the following subscores (0 to 3 for each subscore): stool frequency (SFS), rectal bleeding (RBS), and findings on centrally reviewed endoscopy (ES). An ES of 2 was defined by marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, friability, and/or erosions; an ES of 3 was defined by spontaneous bleeding and ulceration. Enrolled subjects with a mMS between 5 and 9 and an ES of 2 or 3 were classified as having moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Subjects with inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to corticosteroids, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine), biologic therapy (TNF blockers, vedolizumab), and/or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors were enrolled.\nAt baseline in UC1, the median mMS was 7, 64% of subjects had severely active disease (mMS ≥ 7), and 68% of subjects had an ES of 3. In UC1, 49% of subjects had previously failed (inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance) treatment with at least one biologic therapy and/or JAK inhibitor, 48% were biologic and JAK inhibitor naïve, and 3% had previously received but not failed a biologic or JAK inhibitor. The median age was 39 years (ranging from 18 to 79 years); 43% were female; and 72% identified as White, 21% as Asian, 1% as Black or African American, < 1% as American Indian or Alaskan Native, and < 1% as multiple racial groups.\nEnrolled subjects were permitted to use stable doses of oral aminosalicylates, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate), and/or oral corticosteroids (up to 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent). At baseline, 72% of subjects were receiving aminosalicylates, 21% of subjects were receiving immunomodulators, and 43% of subjects were receiving corticosteroids. Concomitant biologic therapies or JAK inhibitors were not permitted.\nIn UC1, the primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 12 as defined by the mMS. Secondary endpoints at Week 12 included endoscopic improvement, clinical response, and histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement. Clinical remission was achieved in 23% of patients with Tremfya vs. 8% with placebo (treatment difference 15%, 95% CI: 10, 20; p < 0.001).\nMaintenance Trial: UC2\nThe maintenance trial (UC2) evaluated 568 subjects who received one of two intravenous Tremfya induction regimens, including the recommended 200 mg regimen, for 12 weeks in Studies UC1 or UC3 (induction dose-finding study) and demonstrated clinical response per mMS after 12 weeks. Subjects were rerandomized to receive a subcutaneous maintenance regimen of either Tremfya 100 mg every 8 weeks, Tremfya 200 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo for up to an additional 44 weeks.\nIn UC2, 42% of subjects had failed (inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance) treatment with one or more biologics or JAK inhibitors.\nThe primary endpoint was clinical remission at Week 44 defined by mMS. Secondary endpoints included corticosteroid-free clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement, all at Week 44 and maintenance of clinical remission at Week 44 in subjects who achieved clinical remission 12 weeks after intravenous Tremfya induction treatment. Clinical remission was achieved in 45% of patients with Tremfya 100 mg, 50% with Tremfya 200 mg, and 19% with placebo. Treatment difference vs. placebo was 25% (95% CI: 16, 34; p < 0.001) for Tremfya 100 mg and 30% (95% CI: 21, 38; p < 0.001) for Tremfya 200 mg.",

    "summary": "Tremfya (guselkumab) is a human monoclonal IgG1λ antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23 (IL-23) and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. UHC covers Tremfya for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s Disease in adult patients who meet specific criteria, including diagnosis confirmation, administration protocols (three intravenous induction doses), and lack of concurrent use with other targeted immunomodulators. For ulcerative colitis, patients must have had prior inadequate response to corticosteroids/immunosuppressants or prior treatment with a targeted immunomodulator. For Crohn’s disease, patients must have a history of failure to conventional therapies or prior treatment with a targeted immunomodulator. Prescriptions must be by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist. Clinical evidence from the UC1 and UC2 trials supports the use of Tremfya in ulcerative colitis, demonstrating clinical remission and endoscopic improvement. The policy was updated on 05/01/2025 to include coverage criteria for Crohn’s disease.",

    "summary": "Tysabri (natalizumab) is a medication used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD). For MS, it is indicated for clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. For Crohn's disease, it is used for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in adults with evidence of inflammation who have had an inadequate response or are unable to tolerate conventional therapies and TNF-α inhibitors. UHC covers Tysabri for relapsing forms of MS and moderate to severe Crohn's disease when specific criteria are met, including diagnosis confirmation, failure of conventional therapies, and absence of concomitant immunosuppressants or TNF-α inhibitors. The coverage is based on clinical evidence from studies like STRATA, TOP, and Cochrane reviews, which demonstrate the drug's efficacy in reducing relapse rates and disability worsening in MS, and inducing remission in CD. Initial and continued authorization is limited to 12 months, and positive clinical response to Tysabri therapy must be documented for continuation.

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD):\nCree et al., evaluated the efficacy and safety of inebilizumab, in 230 patients with NMOSD over 44 months in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled phase 2/3 study. 174 participants received inebilizumab and 56 participants received placebo. Eligible patients were adults (≥ 18 years old), an expanded disability status score (EDSS) of 8 or less, who required at least one rescue therapy treatment during the year prior to screening, or at least 2 attacks requiring rescue therapy in the 2 years before screening. Patients who were AQP4-IgG-seropositive and AQP4-IgG-seronegative were eligible; however, patients who were seronegative also needed to meet the criteria described by Wingerchuk and colleagues. The mean EDSS score was 4.0. The number of relapses in the two years prior to randomization was 2 or more in 83% of the patients. Participants were randomly allocated (3:1) to receive 300 mg intravenous inebilizumab or placebo on days 1 and 15, with a total dose of inebilizumab in the randomized controlled period of 600 mg. No further doses occurred after day 15 within the study period. All participants received oral corticosteroids to minimize the risk of an attack immediately following the first inebilizumab treatment. Primary endpoint was the time in days to the onset of an NMOSD attack, on or before day 197. Secondary endpoints included worsening of EDSS score from baseline, change from baseline in low-contrast visual acuity binocular score; cumulative total number of active MRI lesions, and number of NMOSD-related inpatient hospitalizations, longer than an overnight stay. The randomized controlled period was stopped prior to completion of enrollment, as there was a clear demonstration of efficacy: 12% of participants receiving inebilizumab had an attack, versus 39% of participants receiving placebo (RR 73%; HR 0.272 [95% CI 0.150-0.496]; p < 0.0001). In the anti-AQP4 antibody positive population, there was a 77.3% relative reduction (HR 0.227, p < 0.0001), whereas patients who were anti-AQP4 antibody negative had no evidence of benefit.5 Adverse events occurred in 72% of participants receiving inebilizumab and 73% of participants receiving placebo. Service adverse events occurred in 5% of participants receiving inebilizumab and 9% of participants receiving placebo. The authors concluded that compared to placebo, inebilizumab reduced the risk of an NMOSD attack.6\n\nImmunoglobulin G4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD):\nThe efficacy of inebilizumab for the treatment of IgG4-RD was established in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 135 adult patients with a 52-week duration. Eligibility criteria was a newly diagnosed IgG4-RD requiring glucocorticoid treatment during screening, and a history of organ involvement at any time during the course of the disease. Other biologics or non-biologic immunosuppressive agents were prohibited during the blinded portion of the study. Enrolled individuals were randomized into a 1:1 ratio of those receiving placebo or inebilizumab. Glucocorticoids (GC) were tapered off once the trial period commenced and were only allowed for premedication of investigational treatment, treatment for a relapse, or in other conditions not related to IgG4-RD. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to First Treated and Adjudication Committee (AC)-determined IgG4-RD flare within the 52-week RCP. The time to the First Treated and AC determined IgG4-RD flare was significantly longer in the inebilizumab group, compared with the placebo group (Figure 2). Inebilizumab reduced the risk of treated and AC-determined IgG4-RD flare by 87%, compared with placebo (hazard ratio: 0.13; p < 0.0001). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were in complete remission at week 52 and had no AC-determined flares or steroid treatment for flares during the randomized clinical trial period (RCP). 40 out of 68 patients on UPLIZNA (58.8%) achieved steroid-free, flare-free complete remission vs 15 out of 67 patients on placebo (22.4%) at week 52 (difference: 36.45% [95% CI: 21.0%, 51.9%]; p < 0.0001). Additionally, the mean (SD) total GC use for IgG4-RD control per patient other than the planned GC taper was lower in the inebilizumab-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group, with a mean (SD) of 118.25 (438.97) mg prednisone equivalent versus 1384.53 (1723.26) mg prednisone equivalent, respectively during the RCP. Forty-two (62.7%) placebo-treated patients and 7 (10.3%) UPLIZNA-treated patients received GC for IgG4-RD control other than the planned GC taper. The mean (SD) total GC use per patient for the 42 placebo -reated patients was 2202.76 (1709) mg prednisone equivalent and for the 7 UPLIZNA-treated patients was 1148.71 (878) mg prednisone equivalent.",

    "summary": "Uplizna (inebilizumab-cdon) is a CD19-directed humanized afucosylated IgG1 monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive and for the treatment of Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) in adult patients. For NMOSD, UHC covers Uplizna for patients with a confirmed diagnosis by a neurologist, positive AQP4-IgG antibody test, and after ruling out other diagnoses like multiple sclerosis. Patients must have a history of rituximab failure or intolerance, and have experienced one or more relapses in the past year or two or more relapses in the past two years. The treatment must be initiated according to FDA-labeled dosing and prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist. Patients cannot be on multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies, complement inhibitors, anti-IL6 therapy, or anti-CD20 therapy concurrently. Initial authorization is for 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of a positive clinical response. For IgG4-RD, UHC covers Uplizna for patients with a confirmed diagnosis using ACR/EULAR classification criteria, a history of glucocorticoid failure, contraindication, or intolerance, and a history of rituximab failure or intolerance. The treatment must be initiated according to FDA-labeled dosing and prescribed by or in consultation with a specialist. Patients cannot be on other disease-modifying therapies concurrently. Initial authorization is for 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of a positive clinical response. Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of Uplizna in reducing the risk of NMOSD attacks and IgG4-RD flares. The policy was updated on September 1, 2025, to include coverage criteria for IgG4-RD and to revise the criteria for NMOSD. There are no explicit exclusion criteria mentioned for Uplizna in the provided document.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD):\nCree et al., evaluated the efficacy and safety of inebilizumab, in 230 patients with NMOSD over 44 months in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled phase 2/3 study. 174 participants received inebilizumab and 56 participants received placebo. Eligible patients were adults (≥ 18 years old), an expanded disability status score (EDSS) of 8 or less, who required at least one rescue therapy treatment during the year prior to screening, or at least 2 attacks requiring rescue therapy in the 2 years before screening. Patients who were AQP4-IgG-seropositive and AQP4-IgG-seronegative were eligible; however, patients who were seronegative also needed to meet the criteria described by Wingerchuk and colleagues. The mean EDSS score was 4.0. The number of relapses in the two years prior to randomization was 2 or more in 83% of the patients. Participants were randomly allocated (3:1) to receive 300 mg intravenous inebilizumab or placebo on days 1 and 15, with a total dose of inebilizumab in the randomized controlled period of 600 mg. No further doses occurred after day 15 within the study period. All participants received oral corticosteroids to minimize the risk of an attack immediately following the first inebilizumab treatment. Primary endpoint was the time in days to the onset of an NMOSD attack, on or before day 197. Secondary endpoints included worsening of EDSS score from baseline, change from baseline in low-contrast visual acuity binocular score; cumulative total number of active MRI lesions, and number of NMOSD-related inpatient hospitalizations, longer than an overnight stay. The randomized controlled period was stopped prior to completion of enrollment, as there was a clear demonstration of efficacy: 12% of participants receiving inebilizumab had an attack, versus 39% of participants receiving placebo (RR 73%; HR 0.272 [95% CI 0.150-0.496]; p < 0.0001). In the anti-AQP4 antibody positive population, there was a 77.3% relative reduction (HR 0.227, p < 0.0001), whereas patients who were anti-AQP4 antibody negative had no evidence of benefit.5 Adverse events occurred in 72% of participants receiving inebilizumab and 73% of participants receiving placebo. Service adverse events occurred in 5% of participants receiving inebilizumab and 9% of participants receiving placebo. The authors concluded that compared to placebo, inebilizumab reduced the risk of an NMOSD attack.6\n\nImmunoglobulin G4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD):\nThe efficacy of inebilizumab for the treatment of IgG4-RD was established in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 135 adult patients with a 52-week duration. Eligibility criteria was a newly diagnosed IgG4-RD requiring glucocorticoid treatment during screening, and a history of organ involvement at any time during the course of the disease. Other biologics or non-biologic immunosuppressive agents were prohibited during the blinded portion of the study. Enrolled individuals were randomized into a 1:1 ratio of those receiving placebo or inebilizumab. Glucocorticoids (GC) were tapered off once the trial period commenced and were only allowed for premedication of investigational treatment, treatment for a relapse, or in other conditions not related to IgG4-RD. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to First Treated and Adjudication Committee (AC)-determined IgG4-RD flare within the 52-week RCP. The time to the First Treated and AC determined IgG4-RD flare was significantly longer in the inebilizumab group, compared with the placebo group (Figure 2). Inebilizumab reduced the risk of treated and AC-determined IgG4-RD flare by 87%, compared with placebo (hazard ratio: 0.13; p < 0.0001). A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were in complete remission at week 52 and had no AC-determined flares or steroid treatment for flares during the randomized clinical trial period (RCP). 40 out of 68 patients on UPLIZNA (58.8%) achieved steroid-free, flare-free complete remission vs 15 out of 67 patients on placebo (22.4%) at week 52 (difference: 36.45% [95% CI: 21.0%, 51.9%]; p < 0.0001). Additionally, the mean (SD) total GC use for IgG4-RD control per patient other than the planned GC taper was lower in the inebilizumab-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group, with a mean (SD) of 118.25 (438.97) mg prednisone equivalent versus 1384.53 (1723.26) mg prednisone equivalent, respectively during the RCP. Forty-two (62.7%) placebo-treated patients and 7 (10.3%) UPLIZNA-treated patients received GC for IgG4-RD control other than the planned GC taper. The mean (SD) total GC use per patient for the 42 placebo -reated patients was 2202.76 (1709) mg prednisone equivalent and for the 7 UPLIZNA-treated patients was 1148.71 (878) mg prednisone equivalent.",

    "summary": "Uplizna (inebilizumab-cdon) is a CD19-directed humanized afucosylated IgG1 monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive and for the treatment of Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) in adult patients. For NMOSD, UHC covers Uplizna for patients with a confirmed diagnosis by a neurologist, positive AQP4-IgG antibody test, and after ruling out other diagnoses like multiple sclerosis. Patients must have a history of rituximab failure or intolerance, and have experienced one or more relapses in the past year or two or more relapses in the past two years. The treatment must be initiated according to FDA-labeled dosing and prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist. Patients cannot be on multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies, complement inhibitors, anti-IL6 therapy, or anti-CD20 therapy concurrently. Initial authorization is for 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of a positive clinical response. For IgG4-RD, UHC covers Uplizna for patients with a confirmed diagnosis using ACR/EULAR classification criteria, a history of glucocorticoid failure, contraindication, or intolerance, and a history of rituximab failure or intolerance. The treatment must be initiated according to FDA-labeled dosing and prescribed by or in consultation with a specialist. Patients cannot be on other disease-modifying therapies concurrently. Initial authorization is for 12 months, with continuation requiring documentation of a positive clinical response. Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of Uplizna in reducing the risk of NMOSD attacks and IgG4-RD flares. The policy was updated on September 1, 2025, to include coverage criteria for IgG4-RD and to revise the criteria for NMOSD.

Active CD55-deficient PLE was defined as hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin concentration of ≤ 3.2 g/dL) with one or more of the following signs or symptoms within the last six months: abdominal pain, diarrhea, peripheral edema, or facial edema. Patients received a single 30 mg/kg loading dose of Veopoz administered by intravenous infusion over approximately one hour, followed by a once weekly weight-tiered maintenance dosage, administered as a subcutaneous injection starting one week after the loading dose. All patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to treatment with Veopoz and antibacterials for prophylaxis of meningococcal infection. Patients were permitted to receive additional therapies as part of standard of care. Use of other complement inhibitors was prohibited. Ten patients ranging from 3 to 19 years of age (median of 8.5 years) were assessed for efficacy. The mean baseline serum albumin concentration was 2.2 g/dL with a range of 1.1 to 2.9 g/dL. The median time for serum albumin to reach at least 3.5 g/dL was 15.5 days (n = 10; 95% CI: 8 to 28). All 10 patients achieved normalization by Week 12 and maintained serum albumin concentrations within the normal range through at least 72 weeks of treatment. At baseline, seven patients (70%) were evaluable for improvement in frequency of problematic abdominal pain (Figure S7), one patient (10%) was evaluable for improvement in the number of bowel movements per day, four patients (40%) were evaluable for improvement in facial edema severity, and five patients (50%) were evaluable for improvement in peripheral edema severity. Following 24 weeks of treatment with pozelimab, all patients that were evaluable at baseline met the criteria for improvement in these four prespecified clinical outcomes (frequency of problematic abdominal pain, bowel movement frequency, facial edema severity, and peripheral edema severity), with other patients experiencing no worsening.\nFive of the 10 patients received a total of 60 transfusions in the 48 weeks prior to treatment. In the 48 weeks after starting treatment, one patient received one albumin transfusion. Nine of the 10 patients were hospitalized for a total of 268 days in the 48 weeks prior to treatment. In the 48 weeks after starting treatment, two patients were hospitalized for a total of 7 days.\nSerum IgG concentrations reached normal values for age in all patients within the first 12 weeks of treatment; improvement was maintained through at least 72 weeks of treatment.",

In patients who received viltolarsen 80 mg/kg once weekly, mean dystrophin levels increased from 0.6% of normal at baseline to 5.9% of normal by Week 25, with a mean change in dystrophin of 5.3% of normal levels (p = 0.01) as assessed by validated Western blot; the median change from baseline was 3.8%. All patients demonstrated an increase in dystrophin levels over their baseline values. As assessed by mass spectrometry, mean dystrophin levels increased from 0.6% of normal at baseline to 4.2% of normal by Week 25, with a mean change in dystrophin of 3.7% of normal levels; the median change from baseline was 1.9%.\nComparison of viltolarsen-treated participants with 65 age-matched and treatment matched natural history controls from CINRG DNHS suggested evidence of clinical benefit of viltolarsen treatment. Viltolarsen-treated participants showed improvement or stabilization of function over the 25-week period, whereas the CINRG DNHS external comparator group exhibited a decline in all timed function tests, except for time to climb 4 stairs. Velocity in the time to run/walk 10 m test significantly improved in viltolarsen-treated participants at weeks 13 and 25 compared with a decline in controls from CINRG DNHS (change at 25 weeks compared with baseline: viltolarsen, 0.23 m/s; control, −0.04m/s). The 6-minute walk test showed significant improvement at week 25 in viltolarsen treated participants, whereas results from CINRG DNHS controls declined over the same period (change at 25 weeks compared with baseline: viltolarsen, 28.9 m; control, −65.3 m). Significant improvements in time to stand from supine were observed (change at 25 weeks compared with baseline: viltolarsen, −0.19 s; control, 0.66 s).\nIn 2023, Clemens et all published the results of the phase 2, open-label, 192-week long-term extension (LTE) study which evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of viltolarsen in patients aged 4 to < 10 years at baseline with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy. Change from baseline improvements were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for TTSTAND (seconds) beginning at week 73 and remained significantly different through week 205, and for TTSTAND (velocity) beginning at week 37 and remained significantly (p < 0.05) different through week 205. The change from baseline for TTRW showed stabilization of motor function over the first two years and significant slowing of motor function loss over the following two years for viltolarsen-treated participants compared with the CINRG DNHS comparator group. The change from baseline (seconds) was significant for TTRW at the beginning of week 73 (p = 0.01) and remained significantly different through week 205 (p ≤ 0.0001) and for TTRW (velocity) beginning at week 37 (p = 0.01) and remained significantly different through week 205 (p ≤ 0.0001). TTCLIMB (seconds) did not show a significant difference between the viltolarsen and the CINRG DNHS comparator group, whereas TTCLIMB (velocity) was significant at week 73 (p = 0.01) and week 205 (p = 0.007).\nRACER53 is an ongoing 48-week, phase 3 double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial that is evaluating the efficacy of viltolarsen in ambulatory DMD patients with out-of-frame deletion mutations amenable to skipping exon 53.",

In the study, 888 patients were randomized to receive eptinezumab (300 mg, 100 mg or 30mg), or placebo administered by infusion once every 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria included patients that had experienced ≤ 14 headache days per month, of which at least four met the criteria for migraine. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over the 12 week, double-blind treatment period. Eptinezumab achieved statistically significant reductions in monthly migraine days from baseline (8.6 days average) over weeks 1 through 12, was 4.3 monthly migraine days for the 300mg dose (p = 0.0001) and 3.9 days for 100mg (p = 0.0179) compared to an average 3.2 days for placebo. Patients experienced day 1 clinical benefit, with ≥ 50% reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing a migraine after the first administration. The observed safety profile in the study to date was similar to placebo. The authors concluded that eptinezumab (100 mg or 300 mg) significantly reduced migraine frequency, was well tolerated, and had an acceptable safety profile when used for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults with episodic migraine.\n\nThe PROMISE 2 trial was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled global trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab for chronic migraine prevention. In the study, 1,072 patients were randomized to receive eptinezumab (300 mg or 100 mg), or placebo administered by infusion once every 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria required patients have experienced at least 15 headache days per month, of which at least eight met criteria for migraine. Patients that participated in the trial had an average of 16.1 migraine days per month at baseline. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over the 12 week, double-blind treatment period. Secondary study endpoints assessed through 12 weeks included reduction in migraine prevalence day 1 and days 1-28, reduction of at least 50%, 75%, and 100% from baseline in mean monthly migraine days, change from baseline in mean monthly acute migraine-specific medication days, and reductions from baseline in patient-reported impact scores on the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). Compared to placebo, eptinezumab significantly reduced monthly migraine days by 8.2 days versus 5.6 days for placebo (p < 0.0001). Eptinezumab reduced migraine risk following the first administration, reducing the migraine risk by 52% compared to 27% for placebo (p < 0.0001). Through 12 weeks, eptinezumab demonstrated significant response rates: 61% of patients achieved at least 50% reduction in migraine days from baseline compared to 39% for placebo (p < 0.0001); 33% achieved 75% or greater reduction in migraine days from baseline compared to 15% with placebo (p < 0.0001); and 15% of patients on average for each month achieved a 100% reduction in migraine days, compared to 5% for placebo (p < 0.0001). Adverse event rates among eptinezumab-treated subjects were similar to placebo-treated subjects.",

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "In 2022, Servais et all published the results of the SKIP-NMD trial, a Phase 1/2, multicenter, 2-part study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of golodirsen in male patients aged 6to 15 years with a DMD diagnosis and DMD gene amenable to exon 53 skipping. Patients age 6 to 15 years with stable cardiac and pulmonary function, and on a stable dose of corticosteroids for at least six months were included. Additional inclusion criteria included a baseline six-minute walk test (6MWT) of greater than 250m, a North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score of greater than 17 or a rise time of less than 7 seconds. Part 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of four escalating doses of intravenous (IV) golodirsen over 12 weeks, followed by a 9-week safety review. Part 2 was a long-term, 168-week, open-label evaluation of the biologic efficacy (at week 48), clinical efficacy (at week 144), and safety of golodirsen IV 30 mg/kg in patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping.\nPrimary endpoints were the change from baseline in 6MWT at 144 weeks and change in dystrophin protein levels at 48 weeks. Secondary endpoints included drug pharmacokinetics, change from baseline in FVC percent predicted, and change from baseline in dystrophin intensity at week 144. A total of 12 patients were included in Part 1 (golodirsen, n = 8; placebo, n = 4). All patients completed Part 1 and continued into Part 2. An additional 13 patients entered the trial at the start of Part 2, resulting in a final cohort of 25 patients receiving open label golodirsen 30 mg/kg/week in Part 2.\nAt week 48, exon skipping and dystrophin expression were both significantly increased (all p < 0.001) among patients treated with golodirsen, and positive correlation was observed between exon 53 skipping and dystrophin production (Spearman's correlation coefficient: 0.50; p < 0.02). Treatment with golodirsen (Parts 1 and 2 combined) resulted in a significant, 16.0-fold mean increase in dystrophin protein levels detected by western blot, from a baseline mean of 0.095% of normal levels, to 1.019% of normal at week 48 (p < 0.001). Level of exon 53-skipped DMD gene expression was found to be increased by 28.9-fold (p < 0.001), the percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers was increased by 13.5-fold (p < 0.001), and myofiber regeneration decreased after golodirsen treatment, indicated by fewer fibers positive for fetal/developmental myosin at week 48 compared with baseline. Mean 6MWT distance at baseline was 405.8 m for golodirsen-treated patients and declined by 26.1, 64.6, and 99.0 m at weeks 48, 96, and 144, respectively. Two of 25 patients lost ambulation. Among golodirsen-treated patients, FVC%p declined by 8.4% over 3 years of treatment, from a mean FVC%p of 92.7% at baseline to 83.8% at week 144. Control patients' 6MWT distance declined by a mean of 181.4 m [standard deviation (SD), 151.6; range, −401 to 56] after 3 years compared with baseline. In contrast, golodirsen-treated patients declined by a mean of 99.0 m (SD, 123.8; range, −368 to 144) after 3 years (p = 0.067 between groups).\nESSENCE is an ongoing 96-week, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of golodirsen in ambulatory, corticosteroid-treated, male patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. Eligible patients included those aged 6 to 13 years with a baseline 6MWT distance ≥ 300 and ≤ 450 m, stale pulmonary function, and on a stable dose of oral corticosteroids for at least 6 months. The primary endpoine is the 6MWT change from baseline to week 96. Secondary endpoints include 6MWT change from baseline at week 144, dystrophin protein change from baseline at weeks 48 and 96, ambulation assessments at weeks 96 and 144, and FVC%p change from baseline to weeks 96 and 144.",

Three of the patients received a low dose (6.7×1013 vg per kilogram of body weight), and 12 received a high dose (2.0×1014 vg per kilogram). As of the data cutoff for the manuscript publication on August 7, 2017, all 15 patients were alive and event-free at 20 months of age, as compared with a rate of survival of 8% in a historical cohort. In the high-dose cohort, a rapid increase from baseline in the score on the CHOP INTEND scale followed gene delivery, with an increase of 9.8 points at 1 month and 15.4 points at 3 months, as compared with a decline in this score in a historical cohort. Of the 12 patients who had received the high dose, 11 sat unassisted, 9 rolled over, 11 fed orally and could speak, and 2 walked independently.\nA pivotal, Phase 3, multicenter, open-label trial (STRIVE) is currently underway evaluating the safety and efficacy of a one-time intravenous administration of Zolgensma in patients less than 6 months of age with type 1 SMA based on genetic confirmation of a bi-allelic mutation of the SMN1 gene with 1 or 2 copies of the SMN2 gene who are not dependent on invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support for greater than 6 hours a day. As of March 2019, 19 of 20 patients (95%) who had reached 10.5 months of age survived without permanent ventilation and 13 of 15 patients (87%) who had reached 13.6 months of age were surviving without permanent ventilation.

    "clinical_evidence_summary": "A phase 1, open-label, single site, dose-escalation study (CL-101) evaluated the safety and efficacy of a one-time IV administration of Zolgensma in 15 patients with type 1 SMA with 2 copies of survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) 9 months of age or younger who developed symptoms of SMA prior to 6 months of age. Three of the patients received a low dose (6.7×1013 vg per kilogram of body weight), and 12 received a high dose (2.0×1014 vg per kilogram). As of the data cutoff for the manuscript publication on August 7, 2017, all 15 patients were alive and event-free at 20 months of age, as compared with a rate of survival of 8% in a historical cohort. In the high-dose cohort, a rapid increase from baseline in the score on the CHOP INTEND scale followed gene delivery, with an increase of 9.8 points at 1 month and 15.4 points at 3 months, as compared with a decline in this score in a historical cohort. Of the 12 patients who had received the high dose, 11 sat unassisted, 9 rolled over, 11 fed orally and could speak, and 2 walked independently.\nA pivotal, Phase 3, multicenter, open-label trial (STRIVE) is currently underway evaluating the safety and efficacy of a one-time intravenous administration of Zolgensma in patients less than 6 months of age with type 1 SMA based on genetic confirmation of a bi-allelic mutation of the SMN1 gene with 1 or 2 copies of the SMN2 gene who are not dependent on invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support for greater than 6 hours a day. As of March 2019, 19 of 20 patients (95%) who had reached 10.5 months of age survived without permanent ventilation and 13 of 15 patients (87%) who had reached 13.6 months of age were surviving without permanent ventilation. The average increase in CHOP-INTEND scores were 6.9, 11.7, and 14.3 at months 1, 3, and 5 respectively. Twenty-one of 22 (95%) patients achieved CHOP-INTEND score of 40 or greater.
