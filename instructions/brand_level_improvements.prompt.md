For brand-level pages, implement the following layout changes:

1. Display all content sections horizontally in a side-by-side layout instead of full-width stacked divs
2. Remove accordion/collapse functionality - keep all content sections permanently expanded
3. Ensure responsive behavior for different screen sizes
4. Maintain consistent spacing and alignment between adjacent content sections
5. Preserve existing content hierarchy and information architecture
6. Apply appropriate width constraints to prevent sections from becoming too narrow
7. Include horizontal scrolling for overflow content on mobile devices
8. Retain all existing content and functionality, only modifying the layout structure

Note: Content sections should maintain their semantic grouping while displayed horizontally
